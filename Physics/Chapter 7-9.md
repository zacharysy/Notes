# Chapter 7: Conservative Forces

## Conservative Force
- Value of work does not depend on path, only depends on final and initial value

$$W_{ab}=\int_a^b\vec{F}~d\vec{s}$$

### Examples
* Gravitational Force
* Force from Work
* Spring Force

## Potential Energy ($U$)

Where potential energy is defined being $0$ is arbitrary

All that matters is $\Delta U$

$$\Delta U =-W_{ab}$$

Where $W_{ab}$ is the work from conservative force from point $a$ to $b$

$$\Delta U_g=mg\Delta{h}$$

## Total Mechanical Energy
$$E_T = KE + U$$

$$\Delta(E_t) = \Delta KE + \Delta U$$
$$\Delta(E_t) = W_c - W_c$$
$$\Delta(E_t) = 0$$

## Conservation of Energy
* Total energy for an **Isolated** (no external forces acting on system) System with conservative forces is constant

## Potential Energy in Springs
$$\Delta U = \frac{1}{2}k(x_f^2-x_i^2)$$
$$U(s)=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$

## Non-Conservative Forces
$$(E_T)_f=(E_T)_i+W_{nc}$$
$$KE_f+U_f=KE_i+U_i+W_{nc}$$

$W_{nc}$ describes flow of energy into or out of system

$$\Delta KE + \Delta U - W_{nc} = 0$$

## Potential Energy and Energy Conversion 
$$\Delta U_g = -W_g$$
### Potential Energy and Force
$$F = -\frac{\delta U}{\delta y}$$ 

$$\vec{F} = -\nabla U=\begin{pmatrix}U_x' \\ U_y' \\ U_z'\end{pmatrix}$$

### Stable Equilibrium
$$\frac{\delta^2 U}{\delta^2 y}>0$$ 
$$F\propto -x$$
### Unstable Equilibrium
$$\frac{\delta^2 U}{\delta^2 y}=0$$ 
$$F\propto x$$
