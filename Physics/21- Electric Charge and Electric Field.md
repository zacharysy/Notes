# Chapter 21: Electric Charge and Electric Field

## Conductor vs Insulator
### Conductor
* Allows charge to move freely

### Insulator
* Does not allow charge to move freely

## Induction
* Induce charge without contact

## Coulomb's Law
* Magnitude Form
	* $$F_E = k\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$$
* Vector Form
	* $$\vec{F_{1,2}} = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r_{1,2}}$$
* $k=8.99\times 10^9 Nm^{2}C^{-2}$

## Electric Field
* Field is the cause, while the force is an effect
* $$E = \frac{kq_1}{r^2}$$
* $$F = q_2E$$
* Measured in $NC^{-1}$
	* Force per unit charge

## Charge Density
* For continuous charge distribution
	* Model as point charges ($dq$)
	* $\lambda$ for 1D
		* $dq = \lambda dx$
		* $q = \lambda L$
	* $\sigma$ for 2D
		* $dq = \sigma dA = \sigma\,dx\,dy$
	* $\rho$ for 3D
		* $dq = \rho dV = \rho\,dx\,dy\,dz = \rho r^2\, dr\sin\theta\,d\theta\,d\phi$

## Electric Field Calculations
### Steps
1. Divide surface into $dq$
2. Write down the electric field that $dq$ is creating
	* Like $dE =\frac{k}{r^2}dq$
3. Add up all the $dq$
	* Integrate $dE$

## Electric Field Lines
* Goes from positive to negative
* Number of lines leaving/approaching a charge is proportional to magnitude of charge
* Density of lines corresponds to the magnitude of charge
* Does not cross
