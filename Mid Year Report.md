# Mid Year Report

 
1. List the top three things that have most helped you find your place and become more comfortable at Notre Dame. Be specific.

Response:

a. the library

b. friends

c. professors
 
2. How has your first-year advising experience been different from what you expected (more personal responsibility for exploring options, more discussion of the development of skills, etc.)? In what ways have your hopes for advising been met or not met?

Response:
The first-year advising experience has really helped me with determining the right path and focus with my education in Notre Dame 
 
3. In your summer Initial Thoughts ePortfolio prompt you listed your concerns and/or hopes for your college courses. In what way have your expectations been met or not met?

Response:
In my Initial Thoughts ePortfolio I expressed my desire to be able to learn more and communicate better, and also my hopes of having good time management and health. I was able to do these things successfully, though I could improve my quality of sleep
 
4. Which classes have you found most interesting or rewarding and why?

Response:
I have found Honors Calculus and Introduction to Theology the most interesting and rewarding. I have had similar Math and Religion classes in High School, but these two courses had deepened and extended my understanding of these topics. My professors in these classes were also very engaging and friendly. 

5. What have proven to be your greatest academic strengths and/or how have you grown intellectually over the last four months? 

Response:
My greatest academic strength is probably my time management. I always do homework early and place everything I need to do in a to-do list. This helped me to efficiently accomplish all my tasks on time.

6. List the top three academically-related struggles (e.g. "keeping up with my Writing and Rhetoric assignments"/ "finding a place I can sit and think") you had during your first semester. Be specific.

Response:

a. Finding good credible sources for papers

b. Being able to think deeply and creatively enough in assignments

c. Getting a good seat at the library

7. This question is related to the one above, but slightly different. It focuses on how you overcame academic difficulties. Every student feels like they have failed at something - a paper, an exam, an audition, or a tryout. Which classes were the most challenging for you, and how did you handle these challenges? What are some of the ways that you have managed to rebound from setbacks? 

Response:
I found Art History and Honors Calculus the most challenging courses. Being heavily STEM-focused, Art History was something very different than what I am used, and so I spent more time in this course to be able to really understand the material. I have always been drawn to difficult math courses, and so while Honors Calc was challenging, it was this challenge that encouraged me to try my hardest to succeed.
 
8. This question is even more specific. Which of your study strategies are working well for you and which are not? What adjustments in how you study do you hope to make this semester? 

Response:
Studying in the library has worked well for me because it helps me to get in the mindset of studying faster because I am making an active decision to go somewhere to study. I think my study strategies in general have been working well and I don't think there is anything I need to adjust.

 
9. The University Core courses are organized around “ways of knowing.” The Office of the Provost webpage on the Core Curriculum points out that “The ways of knowing approach reflects our belief that students who have a wide range of intellectual capacities are better equipped to make a difference in the world. Each of these ways of knowing represents an important modality for approaching, analyzing, and understanding different aspects of our lives and our world.” Which of your first-semester courses most clearly or helpfully assisted you in developing a "way of knowing" and how did it do so?

Response:
Many of my first-semester courses assisted me in developing a "way of knowing", such as Honors Calculus, Theology, and Art History. Honors Calc gave me a better understanding of the reasons for why mathematics works the way it does. Theology allowed me to justify my faith and why the church believes the things it does. Art History helped me have a background and language for objectively discussing and evaluating art.

10. What major are you considering studying?  What attracts you to this major now that you have completed a semester at ND?

I am completely decided on Computer Science as a major because of my interest in programming, technology, and mathematics
