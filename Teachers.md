Good day Prof. Speaks!

I just wanted to say thank you for your class last semester. I've been meaning to write this email since Christmas break, but things got busy so it's a bit late.

Also I went home to the Philippines for Christmas and brought back some snacks I'm giving to a few of my professors, so I was wondering when would be a good time to visit your office to give it.

Thanks again for a great first semester. I found Art History really fun and interesting, and I genuinely learned a lot. I've always liked to admire art but this was my first time taking a formal class on it. I hope I was able to contribute well in discussion. I'm very introverted so I tend not to talk a lot, especially in a field like art which I am very unfamiliar with. Your comments on my papers have been really encouraging to me and helped me to look at art more deeply. I'll definitely miss having a class like this, especially since the requirements for Engineering are very rigid and I likely won't be able to take another art course. I won't forget the things that I learned and I hope I'll be able to apply them in my other classes or whenever I'm in a museum. Lastly, thanks for introducing me to Charles Gaines who is now probably my favorite artist.

I hope this email isn't too long, I know professors can be very busy. Happy new year and good luck with everything.
