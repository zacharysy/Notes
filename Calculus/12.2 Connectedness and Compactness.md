# 12.2 Connectedness and Compactness

## Path Connected Sets
* A subset $X\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is called **path connected** if 
	* for all $\mathbf{p_0,p_1}\in X$
	* there exists a continuous path $\boldsymbol{\gamma}:[0,1]\rightarrow X$ such that
		* $\boldsymbol{\gamma}(0)=\mathbf{p_0}$
		* $\boldsymbol{\gamma}(1)=\mathbf{p_1}$


### Example of Connected Sets
*  Convex Set (Proposition 12.25)
*  The set $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{\mathbf{0}\}$ where $n\geq 2$
	*  Since you can just move around origin because if a line segment consists of the origin, there exists a non collinear vector where you can pick another point to go around origin

### Proposition 12.26
* Let $X\subset \mathbb{R}$, the following statements are equivalent
	* $X$ is path connected
	* $X$ is an interval

### Proposition (Can't find in notes)
* $X\in\mathbb{R}^n$ path connected
* $\mathbf{F}:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ continuous
* Then $\mathbf{F}(X)$ is path connected  

### Intermediate Value Theorem for higher dimensions
* $X\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ path connected
* $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is continuous
* then $f(X)$ in an interval in $\mathbb{R}$

## Compactness
* An attribute of sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and other spaces

### Bolzano-Weierstrauss
* A subset $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies the **Bolzano-Weierstrauss property (BW)** if
	* any sequence of points in $K$ admits a subsequence that converges to a point also in $K$

#### Example
* The intervals $[a,b]\subset\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the BW property

### Proposition 12.29
* If $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ and $L\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ satisfy BW, then
	* The cartesian product $K\times L\subset\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ also satisfies BW 

### Corollary 12.31
* Any box $[a_1,b_1]\times\cdots\times[a_n,b_n]\in\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy BW

### Box
* A box is a set of tuples in some interval 
* literally a cube but not equal lengths

### Bounded
* A set $X\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is called **bounded** if it is contained in some box 

### Proposition 12.33
* The following are equivalent
	* The set $X$ is bounded
	* There exists $R>0$ such that $$\lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert\leq R,~\forall\mathbf{x}\in X$$
		* or $X\subset\overline{B_R(\mathbf{0})}$

### Bolzano-Weierstrauss Theorem
* Let $X\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ the following are equivalent
	* $X$ satisfies BW
	* $X$ is closed and bounded

### Corollary 12.36 (Bolzano-Weierstrauss)
* Any bounded sequence of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ admits a convergent subsequence
