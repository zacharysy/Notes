Good day Prof. Ramzi!

We met at the start of last semester, but just in case you don't remember me, my name is Zachary Sy. I'm a first year student majoring in Computer Science.

I recently spoke to my first-year advisor (Leonor Wangensteen), and I said I was considering a supplementary major in Mathematics. She told me to contact you to discuss how I would be able to do this. 

I'm meeting with the undergrad math advisor on Wednesday. When would be a good time to meet?

Thank you!
