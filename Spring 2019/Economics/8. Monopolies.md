# 8. Monopolies
A firm that has: no close substitutes, barriers to entry

## How a Monopoly Arises
### No Close Substitutes
Firm's product can't be replaced by something else

### Barriers to Entry
#### Legal 
* Such as Patents

#### Natural
* Such as when if a firm enters, there would be negative profit for both firms

## Monopolists
* such as Utilities (water, gas electricity), Pharmaceuticals to some extent, tickets to events

### Market Power
* Firm can influence the quantity and price of a good in the market
	* They effectively determines the $Q$ and $P$
* For model, assume that the firm can only charge one price for a good (no price discrimination)
	* **Price Discrimination** 
		* Selling different units at different prices
* Difference between Perfect Competition is the firm's demand is market demand

## Price Decision
Set $$MR=MC$$

### Marginal Revenue ($MR$)
* >>>![change in revenue with a change in price](/demandAndMarginalRevenue.png)
* 
* No longer constant like in perfect competition
* Must be less than Price $(P)$
*
* The more elastic demand is, the less the loss of revenue with decrease in price. The more inelastic demand is, the greater the loss of revenue with decrease in price.

### Price Elasticity of Demand ($\eta$)
* When $\eta>1$ (Elastic)
	* then $MR>0$
* When $\eta=1$ (Unit Elastic)
	* then $MR=0$
* When $\eta<1$ (Inlastic)
	* then $MR<0$

* So firm only produces at quantities with elastic demand

### What Price Will Monopolist Produce At

* Monopoly produces quantity $(Q_m)$ where $MR=MC$ and charges $P_m$ at $(Q_m)$ in demand curve
* Economic profit is rectangle between $D$ and $ATC$

### Comparison of Efficiency

* Quantity will fall
* Price will increase
* Consumer Surplus will decrease
* Producer Surplus will increase 

## Price Discrimination
Selling goods and services at different prices

### When Will Firm Price Discriminate
1. Identify and separate different buyer types
2. Sell a good that cannot be resold

### Why Price Discriminate
* Different types of buyers have different elasticities of demand
	* If inelastic, charge high price since insensitive to change in price
	* If elastic, charge low price since sensitive to price

### Graphs
#### No Price Discrimination
>>>>> ![](/noPriceDiscrimination.png)

#### With Price Discrimination
* Assume that original price is being charged to elastic buyers, and price is raised for inelastic buyers
	* But same picture for if price is being reduced for different buyers
		* Since elasticity of straight demand curve changes along line
* >>>>> ![](/priceDiscrimination.png)
	* If charging at $1400$, the additional profit is the rectangle below $1400$
* With two prices, profit maximization becomes ambiguous 
	* and so profit maximizes when infinity price discrimination (Perfect Price Discrimination)

#### Perfect Price Discrimination
* Charging highest possible price for each unit
* >>>>>> ![](/perfectPriceDiscrimination.png)
* Marginal Revenue is Demand Curve
	* Therefore profit maximization applies and produces at $Q$ where $MR=MC$
	* Like in Demand in Perfect Competition
* With Perfect Price Discrimination, Consumer Surplus is zero and Producer Surplus is that whole triangle
	* Since with price discrimination, there isn't any higher price the consumers could want than what the producer will charge
* Also no deadweight loss
	* an effect of $D=MR$

### Attributes of Monopolies not in the Graphs
1. Monopolies can encourage Innovation
	* example: John Harrison and Chronometer
2. Service and Quality
	* Monopolies don't have incentives to improve quality
	* "Water For Life" by Galiani, Gertler, and Schargrodsky
		* After privatization of water, there was a substantial improvement of quality
