Q1: Tell me something you learned from the talk

Q2: Tell me something you thought the speaker explained well

Q3: Tell me something he could have explained better.

From the talk, I learned about crystallography and the rarity of 5-fold symmetry in crystals. Aside from the mathematics, I also learned about the imperfections of the science community, like how despite Schechtman's findings, few would believe him at first.

The explanations on the platonic solids and their symmetries were very clear and understandable. I also found the differentiation between periodic and aperiodic repetition easy to understand, and clearly seen in the penrose tiles and the 3d shapes. 
 
There was nothing in particular that I thought was not explained well.

From the talk, I learned about a few interesting proofs to different theorems. Specifically, I found the ice cube proof for pick's theorem and the rolling shapes with constant width proof for barbier's theorem the most interesting. 

The speaker explained the theorems and the background of the mathematicians clearly, and most of the proofs were straightforward and mostly easy to follow. There were times, though, when I found it difficult to follow the proof, specifically with the altitudes of a spherical triangle and the lattice symmetry portion of pick's theorem.
