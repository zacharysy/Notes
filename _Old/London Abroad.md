## Actual Thing 
Academically, taking classes in London is a benefit in that I will be more engaged and have a better contextual understanding of the material since I would be taking courses related to British history or culture while actually being in the UK. 

I'm planning to take classes over the summer because I have a supplemental major in Math, so to be able to graduate in 4 years, I need to complete some core requirements in the summer. Taking these classes in London lets me appreciate and enjoy them more than in the academic year, where my focus is on major-specific classes.

Outside of academics, I am also interested in contemporary art and technology. So the Tate Modern and the Science Museum are two museums in London I would like to visit. Westminster Abbey is the burial place of many important writers and scientists, like Geoffrey Chaucer and Isaac Newton. Bletchley Park, which is an important place in the history of computing, is also just a train ride away from London.

I have also always loved British literature and culture. Some of my favorite authors over the years are Tolkien, Douglas Adams, Jane Austen, and Neil Gaiman. Doctor Who has been my favorite tv show since I was 12. It would be a great experience to be in the country of the people that have had a large impact in my life and hopefully even deepen my understanding of their works.
