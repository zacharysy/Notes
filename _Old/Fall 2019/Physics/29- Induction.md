# 29: Electromagnetic Induction

## Magnetic Flux
* $$\Phi_B=\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathbf{A}\cos\theta$$

## Faraday's Law
$$\mathcal{E}=-\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$

## Lenz's Law
* The direction of any magnetic induction effect is such as to oppose the cause of the effect

## Generalized Ampere's Law
* Regular Ampere's Law doesn't have displacement current
	* $$I_d = \epsilon_0\frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}$$
* So
	* $$\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{\ell} = \mu_0(I_c+I_d)$$
