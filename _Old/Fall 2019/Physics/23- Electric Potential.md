# 23: Electric Potential


* Charge makes electric potential which causes electric potential energy $$U=qV$$
* Effect of potential energy is experienced by a different charge than what is causing $E$ and $V$

$$V=k\frac{q}{r}$$

## Potential and Field
$$\Delta U=-W$$
$$q\Delta V = -\int qE\,d\ell$$
$$\Delta V = -\int_a^b E\,d\ell$$

* Charge always goes to lowest potential

## Change In Potiential
* $$\Delta U = q\Delta V$$
	* If $q>0$, $V\propto U$
	* If $q<0$, $V\propto \frac{1}{U}$

## Calculating Electric Potential
* Either
	* Break up into small pieces and treat each like a point charge
		* $$dV = k\frac{dq}{r}$$
	* Solve for Electric Field then integrate to get $V$
		* If it is easy to use Gauss' Law

## Field Lines and Equipotential Surfaces
* V increases as we get closer to the sphere
* Equipotential lines get closer to each other as we get closer to sphere
* Potential is constant on each circle
