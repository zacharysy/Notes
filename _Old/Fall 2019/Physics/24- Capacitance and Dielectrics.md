# 24: Capacitance and Dielectrics

## Capacitance
* Capacity to store charge
	* combined with potential
		* the "effort" to pack in the charge
* $$C=\frac{Q}{V_{ab}}$$
	* $Q$ is charge on each capacitors
	* $V_{ab}$ is potential difference between the conductors
* The amount of charge is then the product of capacitance and potential difference

## Capacitance in a Parallel Plate
* Geometry is the only thing that affects capacitance in a parallel plate capacitor (in a vacuum)
* $$C = \frac{\epsilon_0A}{d}$$
	* $A$ is area of each plate
	* $d$ is separation between plates
	* $\epsilon_0$ is permittivity in vacuum 


## Capacitance in Parallel
* Voltage across each capacitor is equal to voltage of battery
* $$C_{eq}=C_1+\cdots+C_n$$

## Capacitance in Series
* Voltage across each capacitor sum up to voltage of battery
* Charge through capacitors are equal
* $$\frac{1}{C_{eq}}=\frac{1}{C_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{C_n}$$

## Potential Energy Stored in a Capacitor
* $$U = \frac{Q^2}{2C}=\frac{CV^2}{2}=\frac{QV}{2}$$

### Energy Density
* Energy per unit volume
* $$u=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0E^2$$
* $$U = \int u\,dV$$

## Dielectrics
* Is an insulator

### Polarization
* Charges don't completely move, but a little bit of separation

### Dielectric Constant
* $$\Kappa=\frac{C}{C_0}=\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}$$
* $C=\Kappa C_0$
* measure of how effectively dielectric can polarize
### Dielectric Strength
* How big does $E$ have to be to turn the material into a conductor
* Amount of electric field before dielectric gets murdered
