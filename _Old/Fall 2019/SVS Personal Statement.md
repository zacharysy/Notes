### Answers

Ever since I was in high school the one field of study I loved more than anything was Computer Science. Programming has always been the single thing I both enjoy and am confident at doing. I cannot be any more certain that I want to spend my life in CS. And so while still in college, I want to take advantage of all the resources uniquely available to me. This is why I am applying to the the Silicon Valley Semester. While I greatly enjoy theory, I acknowledge that theory is useless without application. To actually understand the CS I learn in lectures, I have to actually use that knowledge in life. The SVS is the best of both worlds—allowing me to actually work in the industry and complement that with my coursework. 

I would mainly like an internship focused on software development. It would be great if I were able to work on apps, websites, or other software technologies. I do not have a strong preference towards working for a startup or a more established business. I mainly use Swift and Python outside of coursework, and so an internship that makes use of either language would also be nice (but of course not necessary).

SVS perfectly complements my academic interest   in that the internship opportunity allows me to make use of the years I've spent learning about CS and creating side projects. Additionally, this work has the potential to actually benefit other people. My main goal in life is to become an app developer, to create something useful and beautiful. SVS would give me professional and technical experience to bring me closer to this goal.

I've been taking Honors Math courses, which are known to be very difficult and rigorous—especially compared to the usual Calculus and Linear Algebra courses taken by engineers. Because of that, my grades may not appear that well on paper even though I have put in a significant amount of time and effort into my math education.
