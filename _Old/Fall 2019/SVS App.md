Subject: Academic Reference for Silicon Valley Semester Application

Hi Prof. Galvin! 

I hope your semester is going well.

I'm currently applying for the Spring 2021 Silicon Valley Semester and need an academic reference from a professor.

Since I was your student in Honors Calculus for both semesters last year, I was hoping you could provide a reference. 

The program is Computer Science and internship focused, and so a reference from an Honors Math professor would be especially helpful in highlighting how I work with intellectual challenge.

Here is the link to the form:

Thanks so much!

Hi Prof. Gerdon!

I hope your semester is going well.

I'm currently applying for the Spring 2021 Silicon Valley Semester and need an academic reference from a professor.

Since I was your student in Foundations of Theology and Writing & Rhetoric last year, I was hoping you could provide a reference. 

The program is Computer Science and internship focused, and since your courses relied a lot on dialogue between students and vocal/written communication, I thought it would be especially helpful to get a reference from you to highlight personal character and my ability to interact with others.
