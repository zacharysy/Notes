2) In your own words, describe the primary topics we will cover in this course.

Continue learning C++ and OOP, such as abstraction, generics, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. Also learning about data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, and also a few algorithms

## 3) State the grading percentages and grading scale for the course.

   Percentages:                           Scale: 
    Flipped Preview Assignments    10%        If              Final Average > 93%,    Grade = A
    In-Class Coding Assignments    10%        Else If         Final Average > 90%,    Grade = A-
    Creativity Challenges          15%        Else If         Final Average > 87%,    Grade = B+
    Preternship                    15%        Else If         Final Average > 83%,    Grade = B
    Highest Exam Score             20%        Else If         Final Average > 80%,    Grade = B-
    Lowest Exam Score              15%        Else If         Final Average > 70%,    Grade = C
    Middle Exam Score              15%        Else If         Final Average > 60%,    Grade = D
    Total Average                 100%        Else                                    Grade = F

## 4) Describe in your own words, the Flipped Preview and In-Class Coding Assignments

Flipped preview assignments have questions related to the next lecture and set up for the in-class coding assignment. The coding assignment will be done in the last 25 mins of the lecture.


## 5) Describe in your own words, the structure and purpose of the Creativity Challenges 

The creativity challenges are 3 interview-like questions. These are done in groups of 3-4. 

Part 1:
Each student will do one problem, and if there is a 4th member, they will independently work on one of the problems. Each student also has to submit a write-up.

Part 2:
This is an Interview Simulation, where for each problem the students who did not answer the problem in Part 1 are the "interviewees" and the other student acts as the "interviewer"

Part 3:
This part is a self-evaluation and each student redo the problems

## 6) Describe, in your own words, the Exam policy for this course

The Final Exam is optional, and is initially the mean of Exam 1 and 2. If a student takes the final exam, only the maximum of the two scores are taken. 

## 7) Describe, in your own words, the "Preternship" program, as well the aimed-for benefits for you as a future professional.

The students are taught research and project planning skills, and interview industry professionals. Guided by these mentors, we will create a project which will be presented to classmates at the end of the semester. 

## 8) In your own words, describe the expectations of work outside the classroom. Also, on the course schedule, I break down the amount of work I expect each week for the given tasks. Break down the reasons why I do this.

On average, we should spend 6 hours a week outside of class. The reasons the amount of work is broken down each week is to clarify what specific parts of the material should be focused on, give us a perspective on the expected amount of time a task should take, show that these activities are building towards better professional coding practices, have proof that the course does not take too much out of our time, and to show an example of what an ideal project managers would be like

## [5 points] 9) What is important to remember about final submission of your code in this course?

The code must run on the ND Linux machines. The code must also use the Production Quality Compiler flags and "using namespace std;" is not allowed.

Failure to comply with these rules will result in a 40% penalty


## [5 points] 10) In your own words, describe the late policy for assignments in this course.

Unexcused late submissions have a 20% penalty for each day after the deadline the assignment is submitted
