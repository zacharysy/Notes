# 1: A Brief History of Computer Science and Data Structures

## Pointer
* A variable whose value is the address of another variable

## std::vector
* May be memory inefficient

## Hash Table
* Associative Arrays
* A key is put into a hash function which returns an array index
* 
### Disadvantage
* Takes up a lot of memory

## Stacks
* Allocate a large amount of memory and LIFO
* Push and Pop

### Disadvantage
* Can only access the top element
* No iterator

## Linked Lists
### Advantages
* Each element keeps information on how to locate the next element
* Dynamic memory allocation
* $O(1)$ insert

### Disadvantages
* No sorting, elements are ordered in a strict linear sequences
* $O(n)$ find

## Integrated Circuit
* Put all components in one chip

## Von Neumann Architecture
* Separate the CPU from the memory

## Grace Hopper
* Invents COBOL
	* first machine-independent programming language
	* First language to use English words

## Self-Balancing Tree
### Binary Trees
* Linked data structure where each node consists of a data element and one or more child nodes

### Heap
* A binary tree where each entry at any node is never less than any of its children's entries
* Good for sorting

### B-Tree
* Uses Pointers
* Fundamental data structures for databases

### Red-Black Tree
* commonly used trees in C++ STL

## Graphs and Shortest Path Algorithms
* Dijkstra's Algorithm

## The C Programming Language
* Ken Thompson and Dennis Richie
* Predecessor of the Basic Combined Programming Language (BCPL)
* First typed language

### Procedural Programming Language
* Describes the actual procedures being performed by the machine 

### Types
* Used to dictate how binary machine values are represented
