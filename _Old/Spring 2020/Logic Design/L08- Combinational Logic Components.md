# L08: Combinational Logic Components

## Adders
### 3-bit Ripple Carry Adder
* Made up of three full adders

### Full adder
* a one bit adder


### Subtractor
* Just invert and add 1

## Multiplexor, Decoder, Demultiplexor
### Multiplexor (MUX)
* Lets you select among several different options
* 1 AND gate per input, and 1 OR gate per output
* $m\times 1$ multiplexor has $m$ inputs and $\log_2 m$ select lines

### Decoder
* One-Hot
* Activates one output
* 1 AND gate per output

## Demultiplexor (DeMUX)
* S can choose an output and input determines the output value

## Decoder As Minterm Generator
* One output can be used as the carry bit and the other outputs can be used to sum with an or

## Multiplexor as Configurable Logic Block
* Can configure a MUX to act like an AND gate
