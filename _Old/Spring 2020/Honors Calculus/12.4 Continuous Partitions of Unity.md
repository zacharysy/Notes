# 12.4 Continuous Partitions of Unity

## Definition 12.62
* Let $X\subset\mathbb{R}^n$

### Closure
* The closure of $X$ denoted by $cl(X)$ is the intersection of all closed sets that contain $X$
* Is nonempty
* Smallest closed subset containing $X$

### Interior
* The interior of $X$ denoted by $int(X)$ is the union of all open sets contained in $X$
* can be empty
* Largest open set contained in $X$

### Boundary
* The boundary of $X$, denoted $\partial X$, is the difference $cl(X)\setminus int(X)$
* A closed set

## Proposition 12.63
* Let $X\subset\mathbb{R}^n$
* A point $\mathbf{x}\in cl(X)$ iff
	* there exists a sequence $(\mathbf{x}_{\nu})$ in $X$ such that $\mathbf{x}_{\nu}\rightarrow \mathbf{x}$
* A point $\mathbf{x}\in int(X)$ iff
	* there exists an $r > 0$ such that $B_r(\mathbf{x})\subset X$
* $\partial X = cl(X)\cap cl(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus X)$

## Support (Definition 12.65)
* The support of a function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ 
* is the set $\text{supp}(f)$ defined as the closure of the set of points where $f$ is not zero
* $$\text{supp}(f) = cl\Big(\{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n f(\mathbf{x})\neq 0\}\Big)$$

## Proposition 12.66
* Let $C,C'\in\mathbb{R}^n$ be two nonempty and disjoint closed sets
* Then there exists continuous function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow [0,1]$ such that 
	* $C=f^{-1}(1)$ and $C'=f^{-1}(0)$
* 
* For any positive numbers $r< R$ 
* and any $\mathbf{x_0}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ 
* then there exists a continuous function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow [0,1]$ such that
	* $$f(\mathbf{x})=\left\{\begin{matrix}1,~~\mathbf{x}\in \overline{B_r(\mathbf{x}_0)} \\ \\0,~~\mathbf{x}\notin B_R(\mathbf{x}_0)\end{matrix}\right.$$

## Continuous Partition of Unity Subordinated to an Open Cover (Definition 12.67)
* Let $X\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, 
* $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $X$
* A continuous partition of unity subordinated to the open cover $\mathcal{U}$
	* is a finite collection of continuous functions $\chi_1\cdots\chi_{\ell}:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ with the following properties
		* For any $i=1,\cdots,\ell$ there exists an open subset $U_i$ in the collection $\mathcal{U}$ such that
			* $$\text{supp}(\chi_i)\subset U_i$$
		* $\chi_1(\mathbf{x})+\cdots+\chi_{\ell}(\mathbf{x})=1$ for all $\mathbf{x}\in X$

## Continuous Partitions of Unity (Theorem 12.68)
* Let $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a compact set
* Then for any open cover of $K$, 
* there exists a compactly supported partition of unity on $K$ subordinated to $\mathcal{U}$
