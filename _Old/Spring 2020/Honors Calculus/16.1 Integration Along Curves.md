# 16.1 Integration Along Curves
## Integration of Functions Along Curves (16.1.1)
* $C$ is $C^1$ curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$
	* $1$ dimensional submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^n$

### Types of Curves
#### Open Curve
* Has endpoints

#### Closed Curve
* Is a cycle

## Convenient
* A curve $C$ is called convenient if it is the image of a **proper**, **injective** **immersion**
	* $$\boldsymbol{\alpha}:(a,b)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$$
	* Since injective, no intersections
	* **Properness**
		* homeomorphic to a line segment (Proposition 13.44)
	* there may be multiple parameterization

### Open Line Segment
* Only really know the length of a straight line segment
* Open segment is the simplest  convenient curve
* $\alpha:(0,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$
* $t\mapsto x + t(y-x)$

### Length of Line Segment
* Let $A,B$ be the points, and $\mathbf{v}$ the vector from $A$ to $B$
* $$\text{length}(AB)=\lVert\mathbf{v}\rVert$$ 


## Length of $C$
* Cut $C$ into tiny pieces that are nearly open line segments, and the sum up the lengths of all the tiny segments result in the length of $C$
* In the tiny segment $(t,t+dt)$ the velocity $\dot{\alpha}$ does not change too much
	* so the length of the arc is given by $$\lVert\dot{\alpha}(t)\rVert~dt$$

### Therefore 
* if $C\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a convenient curve 
* given by a convenient parameterization $$\alpha:(a,b)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$$
* then $$\text{length}(C)=\int_a^b \lVert\dot{\alpha}(t)\rVert~ dt$$
	* independent of the chosen parameterization

#### Arclength Element
* $ds = \lVert\dot{\alpha}(t)\rVert\cdot dt$ is called the arclength element

### Integral of Function over a Curve
* $$\int_C f(\mathbf{p})~ds=\int_a^b f(\alpha(t))\lVert\dot{\alpha}(t)\rVert~dt$$
	* Also called line Integral of the First Type

## Length of a Helix (Example 16.1)
* $\alpha:(0,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3$
* $\alpha(t) = (\cos(4\pi t), \sin(4\pi t), 2t)$
* Using the above equation,
	* $$\int_H ds = 2\sqrt{4\pi^2 + 1}$$

## Graph of a Function (Example 16.2)
* $f:(a,b)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
* Let $\Gamma_f$ be the graph of $f$
	* $x\rightarrow(x,f(x))$
* then $$\lVert\dot{\alpha}\rVert = \sqrt{1+f'(x)^2}$$
* so $$\text{length}(\Gamma_f)=\int_a^b\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}~dx$$

### Disjoint Curves
* let $f$ be over disjoint curves, $C_1,\cdots,C_\ell$
* $$\int_C f(\mathbf{p})~ds = \sum_{j=1}^{\ell}\int_{C_j}f(\mathbf{p})~ds$$

### Few Points Don't Matter (Remark 16.3)
* Let $C$ be a connected curve and $\mathbf{p}_0$ be a point
	* $f:C\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
* If $\mathbf{p}_0$ is removed, then the result is two disjoint curves $C_0,C_1$
	* $f:C_0\cup C_1\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
* $$\int_C f(\mathbf{p})~ds = \int_{C_0} f(\mathbf{p})~ds + \int_{C_1} f(\mathbf{p})~ds$$
* So removing a point doesn't change the length

## Quasi-convenient (Definition 16.4)
* $C\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a $C^1$ curve
* $C$ is called quasiconvenient if upon removing a finite collection of points, we obtain a collection of disjoint convenient curves


### Convenient Cut
* A convenient cut on a curve is a finite set of points such that upon removal we obtain a collection of disjoint convenient curves
* 
* Let $Z=\{\mathbf{p}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{p}_{\ell}\}\subset C$ be a convenient cut
* then $C\setminus Z$ is the union of disjoint convenient curves

#### Union of Convenient Cuts
* Let $Z_1,Z_2$ be convenient cuts
* then $Z=Z_1\cup Z_2$ is also a convenient cut

### To Integrate a Function over a Quasiconvenient curve
1. Choose a convenient cut $Z$
2. Remove $Z$ from $C$
3. Integrate over $C\setminus Z$
	* Basically integrate each disjoint curve then sum them up


## Curves with Boundary (Definition 16.7)
* A curve but with endpoints included
	* the endpoints are the boundary
* Are compact sets
	* compact curves without boundary are compact curves with empty boundary
* Points are of two types
	* Interior point
	* boundary point
		* the end points
* A curve with boundary is a disjoint union of curves of the following types
	* An open curve with endpoints
	* A curve that is a closed loop

### Interior
* Suppose $C$ is a connected curve with nonempty boundary.
* The interior (remove the boundary) is convenient
* $$\int_C f(\mathbf{x})~d\mathbf{x} = \int_{\text{int}(C)} f(\mathbf{x})~d\mathbf{x}$$

## Curve of Intersection of a Sphere with Cone (Example 16.13)
* It's long, it's in the notes

## Differential 1-form (Line Integrals of the 2nd Type) (16.1.2)
* $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is on open set
* A differential form of degree $1$ on $U$ is an expression of the type 
	* $$\omega=\omega_1dx^1+\cdots+\omega_ndx^n$$ 
* where $\omega_1,\cdots,\omega_n:U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ (called coefficients) are continuous functions on $U$
* $\Omega^1(U)$ is the collection of differential 1 forms on $U$

## Examples of Differential Forms (Example 16.15)
### Exact Differential Form
* $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ open
* $f:U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is $C^1$ 
* $$df=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^1}dx^1 + \cdots + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^n} dx^n$$

### Infinitesimal Mechanical Work
* Suppose $F$ is continuous vector field on $U$
* $F(\mathbf{p}) = [F^1(\mathbf{p}),\cdots, F^n(\mathbf{p})]^T$
* $$W_F = F^1dx^1 + \cdots + F^ndx^n$$

### Angular Form
* $\Theta:\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\{\mathbb{0}\}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$
* $$\Theta(x,y)=-\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}dx+\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}dy$$
* $$\Theta(r,\theta) = d\theta$$
* Can be used to determine the total angle a path makes around the origin

## Integral of $\omega$ along $\gamma$ (Definition 16.16)
* $\omega\in\Omega^1(U)$ is a differential form of degree $1$ on $U$
* $\gamma:[a,b]\rightarrow U$ is a $C^1$ path
* then $$\int_a^b \omega \coloneqq \int_a^b\big(\omega_1(\gamma(t))\dot{\gamma}^1(t)+\cdots+\omega_n(\gamma(t))\dot{\gamma}^n(t)\big)~dt$$
* $$\int_a^b \omega \coloneqq \int_a^b\sum_{i=1}^n\omega_i(\gamma(t))\dot{\gamma}^i(t)~dt$$

## Example 16.17
* In the notes

## 1-Dimensional Stokes' Formula (Theorem 16.18)
* Higher dimensional theorem of FTOC
* $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ open set
* $f\in C^1(\mathcal{O})$
* $df \in \Omega^1(U)$
* $\gamma:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathcal{O}$ in a $C^1$ path
* $$\int_{\gamma} df = f(\gamma(b))-f(\gamma(a))$$

## Remark 16.19
### Work (Physics)
* $F:U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ force field
* $F = \nabla f$
* $$W_F = F\cdot ds$$ 
* $$\int_\gamma W_F = f(\gamma(b))-f(\gamma(a))$$
	* work needed to move a point particle from one point to another is independent of the path

### Closed 1-Form (Geometry)
* Suppose $$\omega=\sum_{i=1}^n\omega_i dx^i$$
* $\omega$ is exact if there exists $f$ such that $$\omega_i=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}$$
* If $\omega$ is exact, then $$\frac{\partial \omega_i}{\partial x^j}=\frac{\partial\omega_j}{\partial x^i}$$
* $\omega$ is called closed if $$\frac{\partial \omega_i}{\partial x^j}=\frac{\partial\omega_j}{\partial x^i}$$
* Therefore $\omega$ is exact $\implies$ $\omega$ is closed 

#### Poincar√© Lemma
* If $U$ is convex, then $\omega$ is closed $\implies$ $\omega$ is exact 

## Integration Along Paths with Corners (Definition 16.20)
* A continuous path $\gamma:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be piecewise if
* there exists a partition $$a=t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_m=b$$ 
* such that the restriction of $\gamma$ on each interval $[t_{i-1},t_i]$ is $C^1$
* A partition of $[a,b]$ with this property is said to be adapted to $\gamma$
	* at the points, the motion is allowed to turn a corner but it doesn't necessarily actually do


### Integrating Piecewise Paths
1. One can integrate differential forms along piecewise $C^1$ path
2. Choose a partition $[a,b]$ adapted to $\gamma$
3. denote by $\gamma_i$ the restriction of $\gamma$ to $[t_{i-1},t_i]$ 
4.  $$\int_\gamma\omega = \sum_{i=1}^{m}\int_{\gamma_i}\omega$$

## Orientation of Curves (Definition 16.23)
* Describing a way of running along the curve

### Orientation (i)
* An orientation along a $C^1$ curve $C\subset\mathbb{R}^n$
* is a continuous map $T:C\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$
	* $\mathbf{p}\mapsto T(\mathbf{p})$
	* $T(\mathbf{p})$ is tangent to the curve of the point $\mathbf{p}$
	* $$\lVert T(\mathbf{p})\rVert = 1$$
* For a connected curve $C$ there are two possible choices of orientation
	* at each point $\mathbf{p}\in C$ there are exactly $2$ unit vectors tangent at that point
* In a curve with $k$ components, there are exactly $2^k$ choices of orientation

### Oriented Cuve (ii)
* An oriented $C^1$ curve is a pair $(C,T)$ 
	* where $C$ is a $C^1$ curve
	* and $T$ is an orientation on $C$

### Orientation on Boundary (iii)
* If $C$ is a $C^1$ curve with boundary
* then an orientation on $C$ is by definition an orientation on the interior of $C$

#### Canonical Orientation
* On the unit circle, the canonical (standard) orientation is the counter clockwise orientation

### Convenient Curves (iv)
* If $C$ is a convenient curve
* then any convenient parametrization $\gamma:(a,b)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ defines an orientation
* 
* if $\gamma$ is a convenient parametrization of $C$
* then $\lVert\dot{\gamma}(t)\rVert\neq 0$
* Define $T:C\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ as $$T(\gamma(t))=\frac{1}{\lVert\dot{\gamma}(t)\rVert}\dot{\gamma}(t)$$
* 
* A parametrization $\gamma(t)$ of a curve $C$ is compatible with an orientotion of $C$ if $$\langle \dot{\gamma}(t), T(\gamma(t))\rangle>0$$

#### Remark
* If $(C,T)$ is an oriented convenient curve, then there exists a unique convenient parametrization compatible with that choice of orientation

## Lemma 16.24
* Suppose $(C,T)$ is an oriented convenient curve inside the open set $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$
* $\omega=\omega_1dx^1+\cdots+\omega_ndx^n$ a $C^1$ 1 form
* To compute $$\int_{(C,T)}\omega$$


1. choose convenient parametrization $\alpha$ of $C$ adapted to the orientation
	* Result is independent of choice of orientation (Lemma 16.25)
2. $$\int_{(C,T)}\omega = \int_{\alpha}\omega = \int_a^b\sum_{k=1}^n\omega_k(\alpha(t))\dot{\alpha}^k(t)~dt$$

## Proposition 16.26
* Line integrals of the second type depend on direction of the path
* For any 1-form $\omega$
* $$\int_{(C,-T)}\omega = -\int_{(C,T)}\omega$$

## Chain (Definition 16.28)
* A 1-Dimensional Chain is a collection $$\mathcal{C} \coloneqq \{(C_1,m_1),\cdots,(C_\nu,m_\nu)\}$$
* where $C_k$ is a compact oriented curves, $m_k\in\mathbb{Z}$ is called the multiplicity
* $$\int_{\mathcal{C}}\omega = \sum_{k=1}^\nu m_k\int_{C_k}\omega$$

## 2 Dimensional Stokes Formula
## Domain (Definition 16.29)
* $D\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is a bounded open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $C^1$ bonudary
* The boundary is a $C^1$ curve
* The boundary of a $C^1$ domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has a natural orientation
	* Right Hand Rule: with right hand in "gun" position palm outward, thumb has to point to exterior, direction of pointing finger is the natural orientation

## Unit Outer Normal
* $\nu:\partial U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ is called the unit outer normal along $\partial D$
	* The vector pointing towards the exterior perpendicular to the tangent plane
	* The thumb in the right hand rule

## Planar Stokes Formula (Theorem 16.31)
* $U\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is a bounded $C^1$ domain 
* Denote by $\partial_+U$ the boundary of $U$ with the induced natural orientation
* Let $V\supset U$ a bigger open set

### Force
* $\mathbf{F}:V\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ is a $C^1$ vector field
	* $$F(x,y)=(P(x,y),Q(x,y))$$

### Work 
* $$W_F = P~dx+Q~dy$$

### Green's Formula
* $$\int_{\partial_+U}(P~dx+Q~dy) = \int_U\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)~|dxdy|$$

### Gauss Flux Formula/ Divergence Formula
* $$\int_{\partial U}\langle\mathbf{F},\nu\rangle~ds = \int_U \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y}\right)~|dxdy|$$
* This quantity is called the outer flux of $F$ through the boundary

## Divergence of $F$ (Definition 16.33)
* define divergence $\text{div}:U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ as
* $$\text{div }\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{p}) = \frac{\partial F^1}{\partial x^1} + \cdots + \frac{\partial F^n}{\partial x^n}$$
* So the Gauss Flux Formula can be rewritten as 
* $$\int_{\partial D}\langle\mathbf{F},\nu\rangle~ds = \int_D \text{div }\mathbf{F}~|dxdy|$$
