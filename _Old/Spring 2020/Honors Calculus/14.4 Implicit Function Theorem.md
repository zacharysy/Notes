# 14.4 Implicit Function Theorem

## IFT V1 (Theorem 14.24)
* $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$
* $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m$ open set
* $F=F(\mathbf{u,v}):\mathcal{O}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m$ is a $C^1$ map
* $(\mathbf{u_0,v_0})\in\mathcal{O}$ such that 
	1. $F(\mathbf{u_0,v_0})=0\in\mathbb{R}^m$
		* $F$ has $n+m$ variables and $n$ equations
		* then there are $m$ equations
	2. The restriction of the differential $dF(\mathbf{u_0,v_0}):\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ to $$0\times\mathbb{R}^m\subset\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m$$ defines an **invertible** linear map $0\times\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m$
		* The Jacobian at that point has maximal rank 
* Then there exists 
	* an open neighborhood $U$ of $\mathbf{u}_0\in\mathbb{R}^n$
	* an open neighborhood $V$ of $\mathbf{v}_0\in\mathbb{R}^m$
	* a $C^1$ map $G:U\rightarrow V$ such that
		* if $(\mathbf{u,v})\in U\times V$ then $$F(\mathbf{u,v})=\mathbf{0} \iff \mathbf{v}=G(\mathbf{u})$$
* Basically for any map with the above properties (that may be many to many), there exists is a local function around a small neighborhood around a point
* Basically the $m\times m$ minor of  $dF$ would have all $u$ to be free variables, and so the $v$ 's can be solved

## IFT V2 (Theorem 14.26)
* $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$
* $N = n+m$ 
* $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ open set
	* same as V1 since cartesian product is just a partition of $\mathbb{R}^N$ into two groups
* $F=F(\mathbf{x}):\mathcal{O}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m$ is a $C^1$ map
* $\mathbf{p}_0\in\mathcal{O}$ such that 
	1. $F(\mathbf{p}_0)=0\in\mathbb{R}^m$
	2.  differential $dF(\mathbf{p}_0):\mathbb{R}^N\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is surjective
		*  the Jacobian has maximal rank
			*  if one of the $n\times n$ minors are nonzero
				*  then put those columns at the end of the matrix
				*  These columns are functions of the other columns
* Then there exists 
	* an open ball $U\subset S$ centered at $\mathbf{u}_0$, which is the projection of $\mathbf{p}_0$ on $S$
	* an open ball $V \subset S^\perp$ centered at $\mathbf{v}_0$, which is the projection of $\mathbf{v}_0$ onto $S^\perp$ 
	* and a $C^1$ map $G:U\rightarrow V$ such that
		* $U \times V \subset \mathcal{O}$
		* if $(\mathbf{u,v})\in U\times V$ then $$F(\mathbf{u,v})=\mathbf{0} \iff \mathbf{v}=G(\mathbf{u})$$

## How to Find the Derivatives of the Implicit Function (part of Example 14.28)
* let $m = 1$
* let $x^0=x^0(\mathbf{x^1,\cdots,x^n})$ be the implicit function
* from IFT, $$f(x^0,x^1,\cdots,x^n)=0$$
* so the partial at $x^i$ is $$f'_{x^0}\frac{\partial x^0}{\partial x^i}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} = 0$$
* so $$\frac{\partial x^0}{\partial x^i}=-\frac{f'_{x^0}}{f'_{x_0}}$$


### Basically
* The given is some $f(x,y,z,\cdots)=0$
* Choose a variable to make dependent (for example, $z$)
* get $\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}$
	* set $\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}=0$
* Then to find partial (for example $x$)
* then $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y,z(x,y))=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$$
* which since $f=0$, $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}=-\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}}$$
