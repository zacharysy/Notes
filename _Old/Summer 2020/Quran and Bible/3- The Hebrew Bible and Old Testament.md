# 3: The Hebrew Bible and Old Testament
## Story of Prostration of the Angels to Adam
* (Sura 2) When God tell the angels that He will create humans, the angels ask Him why he would create a flawed people, and God says they do not know what He knows
	* God: "I am placing a successor (kalifa) on earth"
		* High status of Humanity from God's creations
			* which is the same as Biblical tradition
* God tells the angels to bow down to Adam
	* Satan refuses because of his arrogance
* This story was told by Christians at the time of the formation of the Qur'an

### Sura 15
* Has the same prostration story
	* Satan does not want to bow down and God condemns him, and Satan then says he will lure humans away and God allows him to do so
		* Shows the origins of Satan's anger at humans. They were the reason he fell
* Also has a story about the devil trying to return to heaven

## Fall of Adam and Eve
* When the devil is cast out of heaven, he goes into the Garden of Eden
* Basically the same as the Fall of Man in the Bible, but it's satan and not a snake
* Also Satan is the one to tells Adam and Eve that they are naked, they did not realize this after eating the fruit
	* implies that Satan stripped them of their clothing
	* In early Christian tradition, Adam and Eve were originally wearing "glorious" clothing

## Noah in the Qur'an
* Different from the Bible, Noah has a son who did not believe and drowned in the flood
	* Showing that it is better to choose God over family
	* Faith over family
* Noah also preaches in the Qur'an 
	* In Genesis, Noah is not commissioned to save people, but rather to be a new Adam
		* Return to watery chaos and start again. Then God makes a contract that he would not destroy the world again
	* In the Qur'an, he is meant to be a prototype of Mohammad himself
* In the Bible, the main protagonists are not moral exemplars, but they are supposed to be morality accounts in the Qur'an

## Abraham in the Qur'an
* Abraham's father was an idolater and a polytheist, so Abraham leaves him
* Again showing faith over family

## Moses in the Qur'an
* In the Bible, the Pharaoh that Moses confronts with the plagues is not the original Pharaoh whose daughter adopts him
* In the Qur'an, Moses is adopted my the Pharaoh's wife and it's the same Pharaoh who he confronts about the plagues
	* Another example of faith over family
* The Qur'an doesn't exactly have the Ten Commandments (Ex. 20), but it is alluded to (Q 7:145)
	* Q 17:22-38 is similar to the Ten Commandments
* Golden Calf (Ex. 32) is alluded to in Q 20:85
