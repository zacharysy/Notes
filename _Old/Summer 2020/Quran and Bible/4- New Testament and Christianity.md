## Jesus in the Qur'an
* Islam belief is that Jesus did not die in the cross, but someone was made to look like him
* Jesus was said to be preserved in heaven and will return in the end times
* Qur'an verses about the Trinity: 4:171, 5:73, 5:116
* Table Story (Q 5:112-115)
	* Similar to Jesus being the Bread of Life (Bread of Life discourse Jn 6:25-53)
* Miracles in the Qur'an seem to be evidence of the Prophethood of Jesus, and not his divinity 
* Jesus is still called the Word, Spirit, and Messiah, but they do not have the same divinity tied to these titles as Christianity has
	* They say that Jesus is a human, and Christians are elevating him to a God (Q 4:172)
	* In the Islamic view, Jesus is a human and all humans are supposed to worship God. Jesus would never claim to be God
		* In both views Jesus is seen as humble
			* In Islam it is because he is a good servant of God
			* in Christianity it is because he is giving up divine glory out of love for humanity

## Opinion of Qur'an About Christians
* The Qur'an generally favors Christians more than Jews, but it is very ambiguous
* (Q 9:31) Christians and Jews take their leaders as Gods
	* May be because Muhammad was criticizing people who still followed the priests and rabbis but not him
* The Christian monks and priests are good followers of God


## The Apostles in the Qur'an
* Have an ambiguous place in the Qur'an, where they claim to be faithful followers of Jesus but in reality were not great
	* More similar to the Pharisees in the Bible
* Disciple (hawariyun)
* In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus' nature is revealed through His interactions with the apostles
* In the Qur'an, on the other hand, the apostles seem to be closer to the people in the punishment stories who are only saved when they believe

## The Bible from the perspective of the Qur'an
* The Bible in its current form was believed to be corrupt (tahrif)
	* Either it was physically changed or it was misinterpreted by Christians
		* Mostly the latter
* Most muslims don't read the Bible, but affirms the scripture as given by Moses (Tawrah\Torah), David (Zabur\Psalms), and Jesus (Injil\Gospels)
	* The Qur'an says that muslims should believe in these books, but to Islam the Bible is not these books so they don't need to read it
