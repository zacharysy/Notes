# Understanding the Qur'an (Week 1)
* Understanding the structure and style of the Qur'an

## Suras
* "Chapter"
* 114 Suras in the Qur'an
* Suras are divided into verses
	* The verses rhyme, but not considered poetry

## Qur'an Info
* First book written in Arabic
* Islam religion and the language of Arabic has their origins in the Qur'an
* God brought down the Qur'an from the highest heaven to the lowest heaven
* The word of God given to the prophet Muhammad in pieces by Gabriel
* God speaks in third person most of the time, but there are also passages in the first person
	* God is either speaking in the third person or speaking what the believer should say

## Audience of the Qur'an
* The person addressed in the Qur'an ("You") is Muhammad
* The divine voice of the Qur'an also sometimes speaks to the believers, or the opponents of the believers, or all of the world
* "People of the Scripture" are people who God has spoken to before (Jews, Christians)
* "Pagans" are people who are polytheists or have not been spoken to by God

## Meccan and Medinan Suras
* Muhammad first received the Qur'an 610 AD in Mecca (died in 632 AD)
* Kaaba in Mecca
	* Muhammad said that Abraham with Hagar and Ishmael went from Palestine to Mecca and make the Kaaba
		* Showing that Muhammad was not the first muslim prophet
* Meccans were pagans and didn't like what Muhammad said about the Kaaba so he moved to Medina

### Occasion of Revelation (asbab al-nuzul)
* Hints at the chronology of certain passages in the Qur'an

### Codification
* By tradition, Muhammad did not write the Qur'an down. Rather, he recited what Gabriel said to him and his followers memorized it
* The 3rd political successor to Muhammad (caliph), Uthman, who reigned 644-656 had a problem with disputes of how to read the Qur'an
	* And so Uthman set up a committee of people who memorized the Qur'an and material written by previous muslims and created the modern day Qur'an called the Uthmanic Codex.  

## Rhyme and Exhortation of the Qur'an
* The rhyme and aesthetic quality shows that the Qur'an is intentionally written as scripture
	* As opposed to something like the Gospels, which were meant as an account of the life of Jesus, but was not necessarily meant to replace or be added to the Hebrew Bible. It was not expected that they would be recited aloud in churches
	* The Qur'an is God's communication like how in Christianity Jesus is God's communication
* The style of the Qur'an is perfect an in itself is a miracle
	* The Qur'an is a miracle of Muhammad 
* The veneration of the Qur'an is like the veneration of the Eucharist
	* The book and its verses must be treated with respect

### Self-referentiality 
* The Qur'an refers to itself, which is another proof of its intentionality as scripture
* Example is `Q 6:19`
* Probably reflects a sectarian context where the speeches of Muhammad were disputed. There were people who doubted that what Muhammad was saying was sacred and given by God

## Punishment Stories
* Warnings about what happens when people doubt God's prophets
* Examples are Sura 7, 11, 26, 37, 54
* A number of punishment stories are known in the Bible
	* Noah, Lot, Moses
* Some punishment stories are not in the Bible
	* Hud (sent to the people of Aad), Salih (sent to the people of Thamud),Shu'ayb
* What happened to all the great nations that came before (ubi sunt qui ante nos fuerunt)
	* They were destroyed because they did not believe
* Muhammad is doing the same thing as the previous prophets to the people of Mecca
