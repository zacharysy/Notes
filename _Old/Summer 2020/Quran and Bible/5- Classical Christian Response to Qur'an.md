# 5: Classical Christian Response to Qur'an
## Ecclesiology (Study of the Church)
- Council of Nicaea (325 AD)
	- Anti-Arian
	- Arianism: The Son of God (the second person in the trinity) was incarnate in Christ, but the Son of God is created 
		- The Son is the first created being
	- Council stance: begotten, not made. Consubstantial with the Father
- Council of Chalcedon (451 AD)
	- Anti-Nestorian
	- Nestorianism: Christ has two natures in two different persons
	- Miaphysites: Christ has one divine nature in one person
	- Council: Hypostatic union, Christ has two natures in one person
- Both Arius and Nestorius were concerned about the transcendence and otherness of God

## The Qur'an as "Heretical Texts"
- Some Theologians believe that Muhammad had contact with an informant who was a Christian heretic (either believing in arianism or nestorianism) when writing the Qur'an
	- So they argue that the Christianity the Qur'an is denouncing are these heretical christians, not the mainstream Christians
