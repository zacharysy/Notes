	* First is Punishment stories
* Heaven is a return to the Garden of Eden
	* The Garden is in the heavenly realm

* Arabs were believed to be descendent from Ishmael because of the story in the Bible

### Arabic
* The Qur'an is self-referential in that it says it is written in Arabic

## Theology of the Qur'an
### The Trinity
* The Islam opinion on the trinity is more complex than it being polytheism. 
	* Some muslims believe that Christians are polytheists, while others have a more forgiving view of the Trinity
	* Islam stresses worshipping the "entire" God, and the trinity may be incompatible with this

* tawhid: an affirmation that there is one God
* shirk:   ascribing partners to God
