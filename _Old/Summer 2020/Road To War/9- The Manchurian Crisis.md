# 9: The Manchurian Crisis

## Why did Japan Turn to Autarchy and Aggressive Expansion
* Expansion of Universal Male Suffrage
	* The parties became more radical
* Great Depression and population growth
	* Japan needed more resources and land
	* Japan in terms of territory is very small and they don't have a lot of raw materials
	* Japan was heavily an exporter, and great depression hits where America imposes tariffs, which collapses the Japanese Economy
		* Aided by radical nationalism to be anti-West
* Cultural Issues
	* Meiji Restoration created a nationalist myth of superiority against  asian countries
* China
	* China's growing unification by the kuomintang
* Civil-Military relationship in Japan
	* Civilian government did not have control of the military 
	* Dissatisfaction of the general population and military with the government's handling of foreign affairs
	* Class issue: the junior officers were from a lower class than the higher officials 
* The Emperor
	* Doesn't have much authority themselves, and are heavily influenced by a class of people called the Genro
* American-Japan Relationship
	* Initially had positive relations, especially economically, but then America imposed tariffs
	* There were large amount of Japanese immigration that was stopped by American Congress
		* Racism but also a disadvantage because of population growth


## Manchurian Crisis
### How the Manchurian Crisis Started
* Junior military officers in the Japanese Army (Kwantung) made a small bomb and blamed the Chinese
* The Government didn't know anything

### Aims of the Kwantung Army
* Natural resources and land to occupy 
* Massive wave of immigration
* Lots of minerals that Japan doesn't have

### How did this affect the Japanese government and system
* The Japanese government did not have any power to do anything to go against the Kwantung Army
* Shidehara, prime minister at the time, resigns. His successor, suyoshi is assassinated
* Annexation of Manchuria was popular with most of the Japanese population


## International Reaction
### The League of Nations
* League sanctioned Japan, but didn't do much because there isn't any way to actually enforce anything
	* And Japan basically quit the League
* Lytton Report
	* An objective report on what was happening in Japan and Manchuruia
	* A commission was created to investigate in Manchuria
	* Leads to no action from the league

### United States
* More responsive than the League
* Starts to build up their navy again in violation of the Washington System since Japan didn't follow the Washington System by invading China

## Consequences
* Discredited the League of Nations since it showed they had no power in stopping Japan
* Can be considered the start of the Second World War in Asia
