# 3: Ending the War

## Armistice
* Hundred Days Offensive
	* The Allies were advancing dramatically in the Western Front, and so the German armies were pushed back
* Famines breaking out across Germany, Austro-Hungary was collapsing
* The entire German Navy mutinies against the government

## Treaty of Versailles
* The victorious Allies get together in 1919 to draft a treaty
* Major Leaders
	* Lloyd George (Britain), Georges Clemenceau (France), Woodrow Wilson (American)
* Other Representatives
	* Italy, Japan, India, Vietnam, etc.

### Goals 
#### Woodrow Wilson
* Create a New Wold Order
* Much more rational and stable international relations
* Establishing the League of Nations

#### Lloyd George
* Balance of Power in Europe
* restore their community

#### Georges Clemenceau
* Reduce neighboring threats like Germany
	* Germany was larger than France

#### Italians
* Territorial gains

#### Japanese
* Ban on racial discrimination in international politics

### Mock Treaty 
#### What Germany Is Going to Look Like
* Giving back Belgium land
* Giving France Luxembourg and Alsace Lorraine
* Make Poland

#### What Punishments on Germany
* Pay some amount but we'll figure out later

#### What to do with Germany's Military
* Reduce size to like 75,000 with 2000 officers and audited


## Consequences of Treaty
### Military
* Heavy disarmament
* Cut the military by 97%
* Trial of Generals as War Criminals
	* The Allies eventually did not try anyone of war crimes
* Banned and destruction of military equipment
* Remove drafting

### Territorial Changes
* Large portion of the Prussian states turns into Poland
* France gets back Alsace-Lorraine and a buffer zone (in the Rhineland)
* Parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Russian Empire break up into smaller countries
	* Self-determination
		* ruled by people of the same ethnicity and culture
		* Desired by Woodrow Wilson
	* Advantageous to Germany since its neighbors are no longer unified

### Reparations
* $3.3 billion was given in the public that Germany had to pay 
	* 2/3 of the bill did not actually had to be paid
	* The large amount allows Allied leaders to look good to their public and soldiers who had great losses in the war

## Severity of the Treaty
* Many historians say that the treaty is too lenient in application because it led to a lot of resentment in Germany but most of the treaty was not even enforced or if they were, not for very long
