# 6: The Unstable Peace
## Policies of Versailles for Germany that Need to be Maintained
* Military disarmament
* Reparation payments
* Territorial separations

## Lack of Enforcement
### Conflict of Interests
* The two big powers, Britain and France, had disagreements about how to enforce the Treaty of Versailles

### German Rearmament
* British and French find out about Germany's rearmament in Russia
* They withdrew their inspection teams from Germany
* British did not want to piss off Germany
* the French did not want to confront Germany alone

### No Reparations
* Germany start printing a lot of money, tanking their economy

## Occupation of the Rhur
* French industry destroyed by WWI and Germany was not paying reparations, so France forcibly occupied the Rhur
* Public perception was that France was being too mean to Germany, despite their right to reparations

## Gustav Stresemann
* Was Chancellor of Germany at some point for 3 months, and then Foreign Minister until his death
* Steers the entire country's foreign and domestic policy
* Received the Nobel Peace Prize for the Locarno pact

### Locarno Pact
* In essence, Germany legally acknowledges their borders and promises not to go to war
* In return, Germany is allowed into the League of Nations and reintegrating Germany into Europe
* Stresemann is trying to appear peaceful to the British and French and quietly supporting German rearmament
* He believed a strong Germany would lead to peace

## German Military
* The goal of Germany was to prepare for a new war, preferably with just France and Poland
* In order to do this, they worked together with Russia
	* They were both hated internationally, and so an alliance make sense
* For at least the first 6 years, the German government didn't really know what was going on
* The British and French has spies and knew about this but did noting
