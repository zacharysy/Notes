# 13: Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
## End of Appeasement
* There was a change in opinion around the time Germany invaded Czechkoslovakia
	* The excuse of national self-determination no longer applied
* The British made a security guarantee that if Germany attacks Poland, Britain would intervene on Poland's side
	* France followed suit

## No Alliance with USSR
* British and French did not trust Stalin, and the Red Army was also weak due to purges of high ranking officials and technical experts

## Hitler's Reaction to British Guarantee
* Made it more difficult for Hitler to achieve victories
* His main goal is the conquest of the Soviet Union, and he hoped that he could convince Poland to team up against the USSR so Germany could have a border with the USSR
	* The Guarantee made sure that this could not be done easily
* Hitler decides to plan invading Poland, "we have nothing to lose and everything to gain"

## Reasons for the Molotov-Ribbentrop Part
* Hitler wanted to avoid a two-front war
* Stalin hoped that Germany and Britain/France would annihilate each other, and the USSR could come in and spread communism
* Economically, Germany needed raw materials and the USSR needed military technologies
* the USSR was also at war with the Kwantung army at the time and also wanted to avoid a two-front war
* Stalin also needed time to militarize the Red Army

## Secret Protocols 
* Germany and USSR would divide up Poland, and other Eastern European states
	* Germany gets Western Poland
	* USSR would occupy all of Lithuania, Eastern Poland, and Finland
* All the ethnic Germans would be sent to Germany and not killed
* Quiet military cooperation

## Invasion of Poland
* In September 1939, Germany invades Poland
* First occurrence of Blitzkrieg, they move very quickly
* The Poles stand their ground until the USSR assists Germany and finally destroy Poland
* The British and French finally declare war on Germany 
	* But they can't really do anything
