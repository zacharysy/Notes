# 5: League of Nations and the New World Order

## League of Nations
### Intellectual Reason
* Immanuel Kant
* Sense that there needs to be international law and a mechanism for international order to be preserved 

### Woodrow Wilson
* Main architect of the League of Nations
* Pueblo Speech
	* Wilson is trying to combat the notion that the US should stay out of international affairs
	* Collective Security (Article X)
		* Whole host of countries sign up with the understanding that if any state gets aggressive, all the other states step in and stop that state
	* Disarmament
		* Wilson says that WWI was also a result of a naval arms race
		* If people don't have weapons, then they won't go to war
* League Charter/Covenant
	* Put in every treaty in the Versailles System
	* League of Nations is the new legitimizing organization of international law
		* A supernational legislature

### Tools and Structure
* Structure: 3 Parts
	* Council
		* Permanent Members: UK, France, Italy, Japan
		* 4 more rotating members
	* Assembly
		* All independent states
		* Around 40 countries
	* Secretariat
		* Group of experts to handle other matters 
		* Court of Justice
		* International labor association
		* Rules for commercial airlines, railway transportation, etc
		* Standardize internationally
* Unanimity
	* All states must agree with a decision
	* Without unanimity there is a threat of states not agreeing with the decision and just leave
	* But because of unanimity, there is usually nothing actually done
* Enforcement
	* Wilson: International public opinion. Public condemnation will change state behavior
* Sanctions
	* Can impose economic and political sanctions
	* In practice, states were undermining the sanctions for personal gain
* Force
	* No military force
	* So they couldn't do anything

### Mandate System
* Management system to transitioning states from former German colonies into independent states (self determination)
* Dangerous for British and French power because this will eventually lead to the dismantling of their colonies

### British and French Opinion
* Became in charge of a flawed system

## Washington Conference System
* Focused on naval disarmament
* Puts a cap on naval ship building per country
* Also a treaty for Chinese sovereignty
* Problem is the status quo powers are the ones that are most likely to follow, while revisionist states like Japan has no incentive to
