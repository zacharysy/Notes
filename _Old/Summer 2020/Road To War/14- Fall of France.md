# 14: Fall of France

## Phoney Wars
* Very little fighting in the western front
* Hitler took over Denmark, Norway


## Why Did France Lose So Quickly
* Military Leadership
	* Junior officers in Germany were given more initiative than in France, and they had better communication technology like the radio
	* The Senior officers in France were also older and more conservative since they were the winning side of the First World War
* Internal political disunity
	* Lack of national unity
* Bad Defense
	* Maginot Line was mostly around Belgium and left a hole in the ardennes that Germany exploited
* Lack of Allies
	* British could not and did not want contribute much
* Mechelen Incident
	* A German pilot kinda gets drunk and then crashes in Belgium and fails to destroy the German plans for the invasion of France

## British Response to the Fall of France
* Right before the battle of France, Chamberlain resigns and Churchill becomes Prime Minister
* Churchill is much more militaristic, and had a more accurate view of Hitler
	* He saw the danger of Hitler sooner than most other people

## Battle of Britain
* Hitler terror bombs civilians as an attempt to break British will
	* But ended up raising morale
* Also attempt to try and destroy the British air force
	* Ended up failing to gain air superiority
* British pilots were able to recover much quicker because of parachutes
* Technologically, Britain also had an integrated radar system
