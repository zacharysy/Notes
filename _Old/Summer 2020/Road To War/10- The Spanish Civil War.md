#### Orwell Homage to Catalonia
* Orwell's experience was really terrible
* Horrors of war
* Low rations, deserters, and infighting between the Republic factions

#### Why The Republic lost the war
* Mismanagement 
* Most of the experience officers are on the side of the coup, so there is a dearth of leadership
* Soldiers didn't really have anything to fight for

#### What the Fighting Was Like
* Mostly trench warfare at the start but became faster moving by the end of the war

### How did it affect Europe
* Showed the large ideological divide in Europe and was a prelude
* Radicalization of nations
* Military equipment were shown to advance and become much deadlier like bombing
* Ineffective diplomacy, Britain could not settle unrest through negotiations

### Why Did the Republic Lose
* Foreign Intervention
	* Germany and Italy contributed a lot of high-speed warfare
* Lack of Management and Infighting on the Republic Side
* Franco was much better in rallying his supporters
* Republic had less resources

### Bombing of Guernica
* The first large-scale bombing of a civilian area
* Hitler also wanted to demonstrate to the British and French of his power

### How Did the Spanish Civil War Show The Weakness of the International System

	* Italy and Germany
	* USSR, Britain, France, USA
* Military Equipment and strategies
