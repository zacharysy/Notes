# 16: Pearl Harbor
## Franklin Delano Roosevelt
* Likes building ships and loved the navy
* Paralyzed from the waist down
* New Deal, Lend Lease

### His Strategy
* Fund allies and restrict resources to axis
* Cut off Japan from trade, especially oil, by freezing international assets
* Sell or even just send equipment to the British

## Oil Embargo
* Japan couldn't attack the soviet union with the embargo, and so changed course towards southeast Asia

## Japanese Decision to attack Pearl Harbor
* Strategically attacking now was their best bet
* They had a bit more naval power, and they thought they could slow down the American navy
* Needed oil from the Dutch east indies
* Racism: They thought Americans were soft, weak, and lazy
