# 15: Barbarossa

## Why does Hitler Declare War on the Soviet Union
- Hitler hoped that destroying the Soviet Union would break British morale since they were a potential ally 
- Also a time crunch since Hitler knew the United States would eventually enter the war
- The Soviet Army also appeared weaker and less organized than the German Army, and so Hitler was convinced he could defeat the Soviet Union quickly
- Communism was also ideologically opposed to Fascism, and the destruction of the Soviet Union was always the main plan

## Outcome 
- Initially successful but winter came 

## Gorbatov Years of my Life
- Gorbatov notes that the Red Army was extremely disorganized
