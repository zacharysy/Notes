Hi Prof. Gerdon!

I just wanted to say thank you for a great year! Both Theology and Writing and Rhetoric were some of the best classes I've had at ND so far. 

I'll be honest I wasn't looking forward to being required to take Theology after literally 12 years studying in a Catholic school before ND, but there was no escaping the "First Year of Studies". While I did dread many of the required courses, to my surprise Theology and Writing & Rhetoric were exceptions. I found both of them to be more enjoyable and meaningful than many of my other classes. Maybe it was the pop culture references. 

I'm a shy person and don't like to speak much—I tend to stutter and have trouble properly formulating thoughts into speech. I found W&R and Theo helpful in helping me to speak about things I've thought a lot about but never actually expressed. So though it frequently led to class not being able to finish on time, I appreciated the discussions in Theo and W&R. I still think I could have participated more than I did, but I hope there was evident effort and progress. 

Your classes were *a lot* of work. In what I've heard from my friends who had different professors for Theo and W&R, I could've probably had a *much* easier time and less workload, but I found the work valuable. I read almost all of the readings (sometimes even actively highlighting and writing in the margins) and put in a non-insignificant amount of effort into the writing assignments. I do believe I genuinely learned from these assignments (definitely more than I did from memorizing chemical formulas), so thank you for the exhausting and time-draining work! I hope these efforts were not in vain and improvements were evident in my writing, but if not I at least now have resources to refer back to.

Also, thanks for helping me with my blog post! I probably would have been fine just posting what I had written—I've only recently started posting my writing online and chose a controversial complex topic to write about, so I had no false expectations making any actual impact—but talking to you got me to think more deeply about the topic than I would have and helped me to communicate my opinions better. 

There's still not much else on my website right now. I'm planning on writing about my overall experience in my first year of college, but I've been procrastinating a lot over the summer (you would have received this email a lot sooner if I wasn't!). I'll definitely have it up *before* I start the second year (I hope), so if you'd like to check it out here's a link: https://zacharysy.net. I'll also be posting revised versions of some of the essays I wrote for your class, so thank you for the content!

Sorry for the slightly long email, enjoy the rest of the summer!
