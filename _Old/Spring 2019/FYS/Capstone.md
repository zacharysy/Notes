### Answer

#### Take advantage of crucial academic and university resources

Throughout my first year, I have really learned how knowledgable and approachable the professors at Notre Dame are. Whenever I would struggle in math or was just wondering about something related to our topic, I could easily talk to my Calculus I & II [professor David Galvin](https://www3.nd.edu/~dgalvin1/). Similarly, my Theology/Writing and Rhetoric [professor Ian Gerdon](https://theology.nd.edu/people/advanced-ph-d-students/ian-gerdon/) has helped me improve my ability to think critically and ethically. My Art History [professor Elyse Speaks](https://www3.nd.edu/~espeaks/) has also encouraged me to  deepen my appreciation for art. 

Aside from my professors, I have also learned to love [the library](https://library.nd.edu) as a place to gather information and to study. I go to the library everyday to get in the mindset of studying, and have improved as a student because of it. The library's various online and physical database of information has also been valuable in many of my classes, such as Art History and Writing & Rhetoric.

In the future, I hope to continue to form close relationships with my professors and find more ways to maximize my utility of the library.

#### Cultivate and maintain a healthy lifestyle

Throughout both semesters, I was able to consistently achieve around 8 hours of sleep (see images below), which is good since that is the recommended hours of sleep. I have also rarely been uncontrollably stressed, and I believe [my stress management has even improved][stress] the more I learn about it. I am also managing my weight better (see below), and I also choose to walk more in order to be more physically active.  Though, I have not been doing well in other areas, such as in food or mindfulness. I am also inconsistent in terms of taking naps.

For the following semesters, I plan to start meditating for 10 minutes every Sunday, which I will gradually increase to every Sunday and Thursday until I get used to meditating everyday. I also plan to track the kinds of food I eat in order to minimize the amount of sugar and fat I consume. Along with that, I am also considering tracking water intake, as I can easily get dehydrated which affects my physical and mental health.

	
#### Engage with diverse communities

In this first year, I have met so many different people from vastly different backgrounds, more than I ever did in my life, and this has made me better and more understanding and respectful to others. Being involved in the [Filipino American Student Organization (FASO)][faso] and the [Asian American Association (AAA)](https://www.facebook.com/aaa.of.nd/) and [participating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXeTPTN1wm4) [in](https://www.facebook.com/events/1043508502486745/) [their](https://www.facebook.com/events/574583069577582/) [many](https://www.facebook.com/events/2124665987849669/) events has allowed me to interact with people who share similar ethnic and national backgrounds but very different cultural and personal experiences than me. I learned about the struggles of being Asian in America—something I never experienced and only heard about online before coming to Notre Dame. 

For the future, I hope to continue my involvement in AAA and FASO, and maybe even be involved in other cultural clubs and communities such as the [Vietnamese Student Association](https://www.facebook.com/NDvsa/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&eid=ARBkMDtTSW_3PS7oPIOJilZRGOkRE1OOXvjkhVItJl8XRM9xN_ySE_aUdOyVDiHTP6YHfwT3O8Z2pom3) and [Prism](https://www.facebook.com/PrismND/?fref=ts) in order to gain a better understanding of these communities and support minorities in America who struggle because of their culture or identity.


#### Reflect on intellectual, professional and spiritual lives

I believe that this first year of college has really pushed me further in my intellectual, professional, and spiritual lives. Specifically, the difficulty and rigor of my math class has increased by a lot. In high school, I struggled slightly with math because I took the [most difficult course](https://www.ibo.org/globalassets/publications/recognition/5_mathhl.pdf) my high school offered. In Notre Dame, I decided to do the same and took [Honors Calculus][honors] even though it was targeted to math majors and I was majoring in Computer Science. 

Notre Dame has also helped me improve my professional skills, such as with [creating a better resume](https://undergradcareers.nd.edu/resume/resumes/) and [networking](https://irishcompass.nd.edu/page/students).

In terms of spirituality, Notre Dame has helped bring me close to my faith academically through [Foundations of Theology](https://firstyear.nd.edu/academics/courses/theo-10001-foundations-of-theology-biblical-historical/) and personally through my dorm's mass

#### Be Kind and Genuine

This may seem like a very shallow and general learning goal, but I find that the most important thing I have learned this year is the value of being nice. The world today is full of selfishness and hate—it is not enough to just be intelligent, community-driven, or holy without any kindness or love. Intelligence without kindness leads to a [loss of ethics and privacy](https://news.yahoo.com/facebook-takes-3b-charge-ftc-201151294.html). A strong sense of community without kindness leads to [neo-nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump). Supposed holiness without kindness leads to [abuse and discrimination](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html). Therefore in today's society, the most important value to learn is kindness. 

In Moreau, this is related to the goal of *Engaging with diverse communities*. Part of [cultural competence](https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story) and [inclusivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVCBjLBwXoI) is to understand others in order to empathize with them. Learning the [signs of unhealthy relationships](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B93cIKOnINCLS1JpUzZ5Q1JseGs/view) helps us be aware of when we are not being kind to others.

Kindness and being genuine also deals with the self in that it is impossible to be kind to others if we are not kind to ourselves. This is related to the two learning goals of *cultivating and maintaining a healthy lifestyle* and *reflecting on intellectual, professional, and spiritual lives*.  By caring for ourselves, we become ready to care for others.


## Prompt 2 (300 Words)
Write a letter to your freshman self. Think about the examples from Week 12 this semester. How have you changed since August 2018? How has your perspective on your Notre Dame experience changed? How has the Moreau First Year Experience and the Five Pillars of a Holy Cross Education played a role in your first year?

### Answer

Zachary,

A lot has changed, but at the same time nothing has changed. Most of what you expected from Notre Dame and what your experience would be like are true. You will enjoy football, but not enough to go watch it a second time. Socializing—in dorms, clubs, and parties—will feel hard and unnatural, and you will mostly avoid it. You won't be struggling in any class aside from [math][honors], but that was expected. You yourself have not changed. You are still who you have always been, and your beliefs and values have only been reinforced by your experiences and education. This includes not enjoying Economics, which you should never take again. 

One thing that may surprise you, is that you have found people you are [comfortable with][belonging]. This is a very white and very catholic university full of people who are rich and privileged. You have never identified with or have been comfortable with these kinds of people, but that's okay because Notre Dame is full of other people more similar to you. One of the Pillars of a Holy Cross Education is [Family][fam], and while Notre Dame likes to stress being one "Notre Dame community", I find that this pillar shines brighter in the small communities—with your friends in class, in [FASO][faso], or in small events. While you personally have not felt any racism or classism, many people close to you have felt it, and it is also part of the pillar of Family to be able to empathize with them and be mindful of their struggles. 

Early on in the year, you will try to keep good and healthy habits. You will try to sleep early, take naps in the afternoon, maybe do some meditation, or eat fruits and vegetables. Unavoidably, this healthy lifestyle will not last long. There will be personal struggles which will cause anxiety and at times lead to restlessness. At times, it will be more desirable to finish all your homework early rather than take a break or sleep. Thankfully, Moreau—throughout the two semesters—will never stop stressing the need to take care of yourself. Nothing you will hear in Moreau will be new—you know all about [sleep], [meditation], [stress], [discernment], [career development][career], [God], [privilege][priv]—but that is not necessarily a bad thing, because you definitely need to be reminded. 

From,<br>
Zachary
