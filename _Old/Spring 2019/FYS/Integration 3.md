## Prompt 1: Health and Wellness, Career

**A Day in The (Future) Life**

In ten years, I would just be around 7 years out of college. I can imagine myself working in a well-known technology company hopefully with the same prominence hat Apple or Google has in our society today. I would also be running a number of different side projects, such as a mobile/web app, with a fairly reasonable following. My main goal at this point would be to continue to explore different side projects and keep performing well in my job, with the end goal of becoming an independent developer.

One of the values or skills I am practicing in Moreau that would be important for this possible future is the significance of self-care, such as sleep or mental and physical health. I do not think I would be burned out or would sacrifice my health for my work life, and would spend as much time on family and my personal life. Another important skill I would bring with me is discernment and focusing on my career goals. These would help reassure me that I am doing what is right for me and for others, and to give me something to strive for and work towards.

Knowing my VIPS is also important to prepare for this future. As I previously said, I would not want to completely prioritize working to the detriment of my family and personal life. I would need to keep in mind my own moral and ethical compass, so that even if I get offers from well-known and successful companies like Facebook, I would be ready to turn them down if it is shown that they are unethical in their practices or culture. It would also be beneficial for me to have internships. This not just helps with gaining work experience, but also helps me discern whether I would like to work for large corporations or small startups. While I currently see myself working in the industry, research opportunities would also help me know whether I would enjoy working in academia.

While I do have a fairly concrete and realistic goal for my future, I still have to improve myself to attain it. I still have not done any internships or research, and so I still do not know what specific field in Computer Science I would like to focus on in my life. Right now I imagine working in a large company, but I may realize with an internship that I am more suited working in small startups. It is also possible that I would not have what would be considered a "typical" job in the future. As with the rise of careers being "YouTubers" and "Podcasters" in the past decade, the kinds of new and unusual career paths that may arise in the next decade is unimaginable. In order for me to know what exactly I would like to do, I would have to be more involved in clubs and networking events to learn what is possible and what could be possible in the future. 


## Prompt 2: Spirituality

A Well-Rounded Catholic Education

A Holy Cross Education is not just about attaining the knowledge to be successful in our future careers, but it is about improving the self in all aspects. With the five pillars of Mind, Heart, Zeal, Family, and Hope, the education I receive in Notre Dame is meant to help me not just know things, but also help me apply knowledge for the good of all people. 

One thing Notre Dame wants us undergrads to learn is to be able to think for ourselves and make our own decisions. This is seen in the act of Discernment. Discernment can be seen to encompass all five pillars. 

Mind can be seen in our logical decision making, or in how we conduct research about our decisions by looking at websites or attending career fairs. At the same time, Heart is essential because it is not enough to just be good at something, it is as important to fully and wholeheartedly enjoy what we do. If not, then our lives would not be meaningful or fulfilling. 

Heart and Mind also goes along with Zeal in that we should give our full attention and effort into doing what we love and are good at in order to bring love and goodness to others and make God's presence known. With Zeal, we are able to be fully alive knowing that we are doing what God intends us to do. 

Family is also important with Discernment because without the support and guidance of others, it is easy to get lost in all the stress and expectations as a college student. Along with Family is Hope, because with hope is the knowledge that all that we have—our talents, opportunities, and gifts—are all given to us by God. However difficult or confusing the path may be, if it is good and right then God will guide us through it. 

A specific pillar I want to incorporate more into my Notre Dame experience is Family. While I am doing well and really enjoy my classes and my major, I feel like I have not done enough to apply my skills to benefit the community. The pillar of Family is about being united as one community, and to be able to empathize with others, which I think I lack.

In order to improve myself in relation to Family, my goals are to be more involved in Service-related events and activities. This can be something like Code For Good, or service trips. Another thing I can do is to be more involved and aware about what is going on in the community, such as with politics or current events. Through that, I will be able to be a valuable member of society and use my privilege in order to help others. I should use the voice that I have as someone who college-educated to speak up about social issues and about what I think is right.

I would measure my success in this through how I am able to impact the lives of others. It is not necessarily about how big or grand the gestures are, but that I am able to make a meaningful difference to the people around me.
