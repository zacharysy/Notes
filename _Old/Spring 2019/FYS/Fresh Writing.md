# Fresh Writing 

##  Submit the final essay in .doc or .docx format (please, no .pdf), including an MLA style Works Cited list for all works referenced in the essay. Any images, graphs, or other media must also be properly cited according to MLA guidelines. Please note that we may be contacting you individually with editorial questions, and we reserve the right to make surface-level corrections after you have submitted the final copy.



## Submit a brief biography (approximately 150 words) to accompany your essay. The paragraph should be written in the third person, should mention your name and where you’re from, should describe the general topic or argument of your essay (example: “a rhetorical analysis of Bobby Kennedy’s speech on the death of Martin Luther King, Jr”), should mention what inspired your essay, and should offer a glimpse of your academic and professional plans. You may also choose to thank anyone who was especially helpful in your research or writing process. Feel free to visit https://freshwriting.nd.edu/ to view examples of student author bios (the bios appear at the end of each essay).

Zachary Sy is from the Philippines, and currently resides in Dunne Hall. He is a Computer Science major with a supplementary major in Honors Mathematics. "Using Abstraction to Examine Meaning and Perception" is inspired by an artwork by Charles Gaines entitled "Numbers and Trees: Central Park Series 1: Tree #9", which was exhibited in Fall 2018 as part of the Solidary and Solitary exhibit. Having a passion for mathematics and programming, and an appreciation for contemporary art, Zachary was intrigued by Gaines's prominent use of numbers and grids. This led Zachary to further research and analyze Gaines's art, culminating in this essay, which examines how Gaines employs these symbols of analytics and objectivity to examine our subjective perceptions. Zachary would like to thank his Art History Professor Elyse Speaks for the encouragement and helpful advice throughout the many iterations of this essay.
