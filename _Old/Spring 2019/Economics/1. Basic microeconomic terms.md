# Part 1. Basic Microeconomic Terms

-------------------------------

## What is Economics
### Scarcity
* Inability to satisfy wants and needs
* Everyone needs to make choices because of limitations (time or money)

### Incentives
* Rewards and penalties that encourage or discourage certain choices
* Sometimes work unexpectedly
	* **Example:** Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
		* Increased penalties against employers for discrimination, allows employers to be sued by employees
		* **Incentives** 
			* having disabled worker becomes more expensive
			* not hiring disabled worker is less risky than possibly firing
		* **Paper:** "Consequences of Employment Protection? The case of the Americans with Disabilities Act" Daron Acemoglo and Josh Angrise
			* ADA made things worse because incentives

### Economics
* Study of how choices are made by individuals, businesses, governments in the face of scarcity and in the face of different incentives
	* **Agents (Individuals, Governments, Businesses)**
		* Whoever is making the choice or decision

* **Microeconomics**
	* Decisions of particular agents in particular markets
* **Macroeconomics**
	* Global, national scale

## 2 Major Questions in Economics
### How do choices determine what, how, and for whom goods and services are produced
* Question about **Production**
	* Provision of goods and services 
		* **Goods**
			*  physical objects 
			*  Such as cars, oil, houses
		*  **Services**
			*  Tasks performed by people
			*  Such as haircuts, college lecture

#### Factors of Production
 Good and services are produced by the factors of production
 
* **Land**
	* Natural resources
* **Labor** 
	* Human resources
* **Capital**
	* machinery and infrastructure (factories)
* **Entrepreneurship**
	* Putting the other FOP together to create goods and services 

#### Consumption
The use of goods and services

#### Opportunity Cost
* With every decision there are a number of other things deciding not to do
* Best forgone alternative is the opportunity cost of a decision

### How do choices made by agents lead to outcomes that are "good" for society
#### Efficiency
* **Pareto Efficiency**
	* An outcome is Pareto Efficient if no one can be made better off without making someone worse off
		* Focuses on the marginal gain/loss rather than fairness or equality 
		* The magnitude of the marginal gain/loss does not matter
	* A non-Pareto Efficient solution is automatically a bad decision, but a Pareto Efficient outcome may not necessarily be good or bad

#### Economic Model
Simplified description of the world
Ceterus Paribus (All things held equal)

## **Production Possibility Frontier**
**Example**

|    | Tacos | iPhones |
|:--|:-----|:-------|
| A  |  0     |   15    | 
| B  |  1     |   14   | 
| C  |  2     |   12    | 
| D  |  3     |   9     | 
| D  |  4     |   5    | 
| D  |  5     |   0    |

* **Set of Feasible Choices**
	* Set of all points on or inside the the PPF curve
	* 
	* A set is **convex** when
		* The line created by any two points in the set is also inside the set


### Marginal Cost (MC)
* ![](/marginalcost.png)
* Opportunity cost of producing one more unit
* Derivative of PPF
* Can be estimated by slope between two points:
	$$\frac{units\,lost}{units \,gained}$$
* Marginal cost of one good is reciprocal of other good
* Marginal cost will increase 
	* Not all FOP are equally suited to making all goods 
* When MC is constant then the FOP are equally suited to either good

### Productive Efficiency
* When it is impossible to produce more of a good without producing less of another good
* When Marginal Cost > 0
* On the PPF curve
* 
* **Marginal Benefit (MB)**
	* ![](/marginalbenefit.jpeg)
	* Benefit of consuming one more unit

### Allocative Efficiency
* ![](/mbmc.jpeg)
* When Marginal Benefit equals Marginal Cost (MB = MC)
* Cannot produce more of a good without giving up another good which is valued more highly

### Positive Statements
Stating something that is a fact/true
### Normative Statements
Cannot be proven, opinion

## Specialization
World is increasingly specialized

### Comparative Advantage
* If someone can produce something at a lower opportunity cost than another person
* 
* **Example**
 
* |Person| Taco | Phone | MC Taco | MC Phone |
|:-----|:-------|:-----|:--------|:--------|
|A       |1,4|1,0|$\frac{1}{3}$|$3$|
|B       |1,0|1,4|$3$|$\frac{1}{3}$|
* *Person A* has comparative advantage at making Tacos while *Person B* has comparative advantage at making Phones
* If person A specializes in Tacos and Person B specializes in Phones and trade, there is a net benefit greater than without specialization/trading
* 
* By specializing and trading, everyone can be made better off

### Absolute Advantage 
* If someone can produce more goods with a given amount of resources than someone else
* Absolute advantage does not negate comparative advantage 
	* It may still cost Person A less tacos for an additional phone (Comparative Advantage) but Person B's capacity of taco is still greater (Absolute Advantage)
* Both people can still be made better off with trade even with Absolute Advantage

### Coordination
* Who is going to specialize in what, who is going to produce what, how to trade

#### Command Economy
Central authority decides coordination
#### Socialism
A mix of command economy and capitalism
#### Capitalism
Resources and decisions are privatized

* __Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith__
	* Capitalist economy can solve problems of coordination even without thinking about solving problem
	* __Key Institutions__
		* __Firm__
			* Economic unit that hires factors of production and organizes them to produce goods and services
		* __Markets__
			* An arrangement where buyers and sellers can get information and do business with each other

### Types of Markets
![](/factorProductMarket.png)
#### Product Market
**Firms supply** goods and services to consumers, and **consumers demand** goods and services
#### Resource/Factor Market
**Consumers supply** goods and services to firms, and **firms demand** goods and services
