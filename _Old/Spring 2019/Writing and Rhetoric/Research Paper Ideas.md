## Research Question
* What Are the Privacy Risks of Modern Smart Speakers (Possibly Amazon Alexa)?

### Specifically (Probably)
- Personal Level
- Company Level
- Government Level

## Plan
### Identify possible risks
* academic journals
* speculative tech articles
* news articles of incidents

###  how are these risks currently being addressed (if they even are)
* privacy policies
* news reports

### flaws in current implementations
* academic journals
* tech articles
