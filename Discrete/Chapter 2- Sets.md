# Chapter 2: Sets
## Power Set
* Set of all subsets
* cardinality of $2^n$

## Cartesian Product
* $A_n$ and $B_m$ are sets, $A\times B$ is set of ordered pairs containing every possible pairs of elements in set $A$ and $B$
* Cardinality is $n\times m$

## Relation 
* Subset of Cartesian Product


## Injection
$$\forall a_1,a_2\in A(f(a_1)=f(a_2)\implies a_1=a_2)$$

## Surjection
$$\forall b\in B \exists a\in A(f(a)=b)$$

## Bijection
* Surjective and injective
