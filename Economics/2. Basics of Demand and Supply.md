# 2. Basics of Demand and Supply

----------------------------

* **Exogenous Variables**
	* Values are determined outside analysis
* **Endogenous Variables**
	* Values are determined by analysis

## Competitive Market
A market where no one buyer or seller can influence price

## Demand ($D$)
__Willingness__ and __ability__ of consumers to purchase goods and services

### Quantity Demanded ($Q_D$)
* Amount of a good or service consumers plan to purchase at a particular price

$$Q_D = f(P,T,Y,P_2,P_3,F,E)$$

#### Price ($P$)
Price of good
$$P \propto  \frac{1}{Q_D}$$

#### Example: Erasers that work

	
* | $P$ | $Q_D$ |
	|:----|:---- |
	|  1   |   17  |
	|  2   |   11  |
	|  3   |   7   |
	|  4   |   4   |
	|  5   |   2   |

### Law of Demand
* Ceteris Paribus,
* $$P\propto\frac{1}{Q_D}$$

### Increase in Demand
* Shift in Demand curve up and to right
### Change in Quantity Demanded
* Movement in demand curve

### Non-Price Determinants 
#### Taste and Preference ($T$)
* $$T \propto D$$
* Caused by current events, fad/craze, word of mouth, etc.

#### Income ($Y$)
* Consumer income

* **Normal Good**
	* $$Y_n \propto D$$
	* Greater income leads to greater demand
	* 
* **Inferior Good**
	* $$Y_n \propto \frac{1}{D}$$
	* Greater income leads to less demand

#### Price of Related Goods $(P_2,P_3)$
* **Substitutes ($P_2$)**
	* $$P_2 \propto D$$
	* When price of substitute increases, demand for good increases
	* 
* **Complements ($P_3$)**
	* $$P_3 \propto\frac{1}{D}$$
	* When price of complement increases, demand for good decreases

#### Population of Consumers ($F$)
* $$F \propto D$$
* As the population of consumers increases, demand increases

#### Expectations ($E$)
* Expectation of future prices
* $$P_E \propto D$$
* If prices are expected to rise in the future, present demand increases

## Supply ($S$)
Willingness and ability of firms to produce goods and services

### Quantity Supplied ($Q_S$)
* Amount producers plan to sell at a particular price

$$Q_S = f(P,W,P_1,P_2,E,F,Z)$$

#### Price ($P$)
Price the good is being sold for

#### Example: Erasers that work
* | $P$ | $Q_S$ |
|:----|:----|
|  0.5   |   0   |
|  1      |   3  |
|  1.5   |   4   |
|  2      |   5   |
|  2.5   |   6   |

### Law of Supply
* Ceteris Paribus,
* $$P\propto Q_S$$

### Increase in Supply
* Shift in Supply curve down and to right
### Change in Quantity Supplied
* Movement along supply curve

### Non-Price Determinants
#### Cost of Factors of Production ($W$)
* $$W \propto \frac{1}{S}$$
* An increase in price of FOP lead to a decrease in supply

#### Prices of Other Goods ($P_1,P_2$)
How price of one thing being sold affects the production of the good

* **Complements in Production ($P_1$)**
	* $$P_1 \propto S$$
	* As price of complement increases, supply of good increases
	* Because complement is more desirable, more complement is produced, leading to also an increase in production of supply.
	* Complements are usually by-products 
* **Substitutes in Production ($P_2$)**
	* $$P_2 \propto \frac{1}{S}$$
	* As price of substitute increases, supply for good decreases
	* Since price of substitute is larger, firms will take advantage of larger prices and produce more of the substitute

#### Expected Future Price ($E$)
* $$E \propto \frac{1}{S}$$
* If expected future price is large, supply is low

#### Number of Firms ($F$)
* $$F \propto S$$
* Entry by firms increases supply
* Since there are low barriers of entry, more firms can produce the good

#### Technology ($Z$)
* $$Z \propto S$$
* Improvements in technology increase supply
* Becomes better and more efficient to produce a good with better technology
