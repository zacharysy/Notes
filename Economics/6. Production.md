# Production (Supply Side of Stuff)
## Firm
* Economic Unit that hires FOP and organizes them to produce goods and services
* Firms maximize *profit* (production version of utility)
# Economic Profit ($\pi$)
* $$\pi=TR-TC$$

## Total Revenue
* $$TR = P\cdot Q$$
* Price of good multiplied by the total quantity
## Total Cost
### Explicit Cost
* Costs a firm pays with money
* Costs of FOP
	* Wages
	* Utilities
	* Healthcare

### Implicit Cost
* Includes opportunity cost, even if not monetary
* 
* **Rental Rate of Capital**
	* Firms rent capital from other firms
		* capital includes machinery, buildings, infrastructure
	* Opportunity Cost of renting out capital instead of using it
* 
* **Normal Profit**
	* Opportunity cost of entrepreneurial ability, amount needed to sustain entrepreneurial ability
	* Minimum amount of money worth to entrepreneur to make running business worth it

## Stages of Economic Profit
### Positive Economic Profit ($\pi>0$)
* Signals more firms will enter market if they can
### Zero Economic Profit ($\pi=0$)
* Total revenue is equal to the explicit and implicit costs ($TR=TC$)
* firms in the market will stay in market, and firms outside of market will not enter 
### Negative Economic Profit ($\pi<0$)
* Signals firms will exit market

# Profit Maximization
$$MR = MC$$
Where $MR$ is the marginal revenue, and $MC$ is the marginal cost

## Example
let quantity $Q=100$, let $k$ be capital and $L$ be labor.

|  | $k$ | $L$ |
|:-|:---|:---|
|A| 2 | 18 |
|B| 3 | 20 |
|C| 4 | 16 |
|D| 4 | 12 |
|E| 5 | 2 |

Let price of capital $P_k=5$ and price of labor $P_L=1$

### Immediately Undesirable bundles
* B since A is cheaper in capital and labor
* C since D uses same capital and less labor

### Taking into account price
* E is cheapest option for that quantity, so it is best option


## Economic Efficiency (p. 231)
* When a firm produces a given output level at the lowest possible cost
* Profit maximization implies economic efficiency

## Determining Quantity
$$Q=f(L,k,Z)$$

* $Q$ is equal to output, quantity, or total product 
* $L$ is labor
* $k$ is capital
* $Z$ is technology

### Short Run
* Labor ($L$) is variable
* Other FOPs ($k,Z$) are fixed

### Long Run
* Labor ($L$) and capital ($k$) are variable
* technology ($Z$) fixed

### Very Long Run
* All determinants ($L,k,Z$) are variable

## Short Run

### Average Product of Labor ($AP$)
$$AP = \frac{Q}{L}$$

#### Graph of Quantity vs Labor
![](/shortRunQuantityLabor.png)

### Marginal Product of Labor ($MP$)
$$MP = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$$

#### Graph of MP vs Labor
![](/shortRunMPLabor.png)

### Observations
* MP is derivative of AP
* MP eventually decreases (diminishing marginal returns

### Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns
* As a firm uses more of a variable input with a fixed amount of fixed inputs, the Marginal Product of the Variable Input eventually diminishes

### Graph of MP vs Labor (blue) and AP vs Labor (red)
![](/shortRunMPAPLabor.png)

#### Zones
* Zone 1
	* MP > AP, AP increasing
* Zone 2
	* MP = AP, AP stays the same
* Zone 3
	* MP < AP, AP decreasing

# Cost
## Total Cost ($TC$)
* Cost of all Factors of Production
$$TC = TFC + TVC$$

### Total Fixed Cost ($TFC$)
* Cost of all fixed inputs (such as capital)

### Total Variable Cost ($TVC$)
* Cost of all variable inputs (such as labor)

## Average Total Cost ($ATC$)
$$ATC = \frac{TC}{Q}=AVC+AFC$$

### Average Variable Cost ($AVC$)
$$AVC=\frac{TVC}{Q}$$

### Average Fixed Cost ($AFC$)
$$AFC=\frac{TFC}{Q}$$

## Example
* Let Price of labor $P_L=40$ and price of capital $P_k=20$
