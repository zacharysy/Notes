# Production (Supply Side of Stuff)
## Firm
* Economic Unit that hires FOP and organizes them to produce goods and services
* Firms maximize *profit* (production version of utility)
# Economic Profit ($\pi$)
* $$\pi=TR-TC$$

## Total Revenue
* $$TR = P\cdot Q$$
* Price of good multiplied by the total quantity
## Total Cost
### Explicit Cost
* Costs a firm pays with money
* Costs of FOP
	* Wages
	* Utilities
	* Healthcare

### Implicit Cost
* Includes opportunity cost, even if not monetary
* 
* **Rental Rate of Capital**
	* Firms rent capital from other firms
		* capital includes machinery, buildings, infrastructure
	* Opportunity Cost of renting out capital instead of using it
* 
* **Normal Profit**
	* Opportunity cost of entrepreneurial ability, amount needed to sustain entrepreneurial ability
	* Minimum amount of money worth to entrepreneur to make running business worth it

## Stages of Economic Profit
### Positive Economic Profit ($\pi>0$)
* Signals more firms will enter market if they can
### Zero Economic Profit ($\pi=0$)
* Total revenue is equal to the explicit and implicit costs ($TR=TC$)
* firms in the market will stay in market, and firms outside of market will not enter 
### Negative Economic Profit ($\pi<0$)
* Signals firms will exit market

# Profit Maximization
$$MR = MC$$
Where $MR$ is the marginal revenue, and $MC$ is the marginal cost

## Example
let quantity $Q=100$, let $k$ be capital and $L$ be labor.

|  | $k$ | $L$ |
|:-|:---|:---|
|A| 2 | 18 |
|B| 3 | 20 |
|C| 4 | 16 |
|D| 4 | 12 |
|E| 5 | 2 |

Let price of capital $P_k=5$ and price of labor $P_L=1$

### Immediately Undesirable bundles
* B since A is cheaper in capital and labor
* C since D uses same capital and less labor

### Taking into account price
* E is cheapest option for that quantity, so it is best option


## Economic Efficiency (p. 231)
* When a firm produces a given output level at the lowest possible cost
* Profit maximization implies economic efficiency

## Determining Quantity
$$Q=f(L,k,Z)$$

* $Q$ is equal to output, quantity, or total product 
* $L$ is labor
* $k$ is capital
* $Z$ is technology

### Short Run
* Labor ($L$) is variable
* Other FOPs ($k,Z$) are fixed

### Long Run
* Labor ($L$) and capital ($k$) are variable
* technology ($Z$) fixed

### Very Long Run
* All determinants ($L,k,Z$) are variable

## Short Run

### Average Product of Labor ($AP$)
$$AP = \frac{Q}{L}$$

#### Graph of Quantity vs Labor
![](/shortRunQuantityLabor.png)

### Marginal Product of Labor ($MPL$)
$$MPL = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$$

#### Graph of MPL vs Labor
![](/shortRunMPLabor.png)

### Observations
* MPL is derivative of APL
* MPL eventually decreases (diminishing marginal returns

### Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns
* As a firm uses more of a variable input with a fixed amount of fixed inputs, the Marginal Product of the Variable Input eventually diminishes

### Graph of MPL vs Labor (blue) and APL vs Labor (red)
![](/shortRunMPAPLabor.png)

#### Zones
* Zone 1
	* MP > AP, AP increasing
* Zone 2
	* MP = AP, AP stays the same
* Zone 3
	* MP < AP, AP decreasing

# Cost
## Total Cost ($TC$)
* Cost of all Factors of Production
$$TC = TFC + TVC$$

### Total Fixed Cost ($TFC$)
* Cost of all fixed inputs (such as capital)
g
### Total Variable Cost ($TVC$)
* Cost of all variable inputs (such as labor)

## Average Total Cost ($ATC$)
$$ATC = \frac{TC}{Q}=AVC+AFC$$
basically average cost per unit at that quantity

### Average Variable Cost ($AVC$)
$$AVC=\frac{TVC}{Q}$$

### Average Fixed Cost ($AFC$)
$$AFC=\frac{TFC}{Q}$$

### Marginal Cost ($MC$)
$$MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$$

## Example
* Let Price of labor $P_L=40$ and price of capital $P_k=20$

|$k$|$L$|$Q$|$APL$|$MPL$|$TFC$|$TVC$|$TC$|$AFC$|$AVC$|$ATC$|

## Graph of MC and ATC (ignore MR)
![](/MCandATC.jpeg)

* When MC is below ATC, ATC has negative slope
* When MC is above ATC, ATC has positive slope

### Parts of Graph
* Graph is U-shaped 
* **ATC decreases** 
	* In low levels of output, AFC is large and dominates ATC
	* AVC also decreases initially because not yet hit Diminishing Marginal Returns
* **Rectangular Area Under ATC**
	* Total Cost

### Marginal Cost and Variable Cost
As quantity increases, graph of ATC and AVC approach each other with AVC below ATC
$$MC = \frac{\Delta TVC}{\Delta Q}$$

* Since in Short Run, fixed cost cannot be changed
* Marginal Cost is change in fixed cost
* Relationship between MC and AVC is the same MC and ATC

### Productivity and Cost
* Labor is only variable cost
	* Therefore only input that can be changed
	* Therefore $$\Delta TC = P_{L}\Delta L$$
		* where $P_L$ is price of labor and $L$ is quantity in labor
* And so $$MC=\frac{P_{L}\Delta L}{\Delta Q}$$
* and since $MPL = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$, then $$MC = \frac{P_L}{MPL}$$
* Also $$AVC = \frac{P_L}{APL}$$

# Long Run
* Basically choosing what short run outcome firm wants to happen after a certain time interval
* And so long run is just a bunch of short runs
* ![](/manyShortRuns.png)
* More capital is inefficient at low quantities, but with large quantities is more efficient
* Firms would choose to be bottom of these curves (obviously, since minimizing cost)

## Long Run Average Cost (LRAC) Curve
Made up of tiny short run curves
![](lrac.png)
Both economies of scale and diseconomies of scale are present, but LRAC show which dominates

### Economies of Scale
* Part of curve where long run costs decrease
* Driving down long run average costs
* Efficiency, Synergy, etc.

### Disconomies of Scale
* Part of curve where long run costs increase
* Driving up long run average cost
* Bureaucracy, Mismanagement, etc
