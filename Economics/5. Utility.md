# Utility (Chapter 8-9 of Parkin)

Satisfaction attained by consuming a good or service

Measured in Utils

## Total Utility
Total benefit 

>>> ![](totalUtility.png)

## Marginal Utility
Change in Total Utility from consuming one more unit (Derivative of Total Utility)

Additional benefit from consuming one more of a good or service

>>> ![](marginalUtility.png)

### Ranges of Marginal Utility
* **Increasing Marginal Utility**
	* Total Utility is increasing at faster rate
* **Decreasing Positive Marginal Utility**
	* Total Utility is increasing at lower rate
* **Decreasing Negative Marginal Utility**
	* Total Utility is decreasing at faster rate

### Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
* Ceteris Paribus, at some point, continued consumption will lead to smaller gain in utility, or losses of utility. 
	* 
* Marginal Utility will diminish
	* Not necessarily negative

## Comparing Utilities of Two Goods/Services
### Indifference Curve
>>>>> ![](/indifferenceCurve.png)

* Indifferent between all points
	* same amount of utility
* 
* **Set of Preferred Bundles**
	* Bundles Outside curve
	* Convex set
* **Set of Not Preferred Bundles**
	* Bundles inside curve
* 
* **Marginal Rate of Substitution**
	* Slope of Indifference Curve
	* How much y-axis good willing to give up to get more of x-axis good

#### Variety
* Shape of Curve determines importance of variety
*
* **Perfect Complements**
	* Variety is Essential
	>>>> ![](utilityPerfectComplement.png)
	* Right Angle
* **Perfect Substitutes**
>>>> ![](utilityPerfectSubstitutes.png)

#### Properties of Indifference Curve
* Can have more than one indifference curve
>>>![](moreThanOneIndifference.png)
* Indifference Curves don't cross

## Utility Maximizing Choice
Maximizing utility in the face of scarcity

### Assumptions
1. Spend all income
2. Set marginal utility per dollar spent equal for all goods
	* $$\frac{MU_a}{P_a}=\frac{MU_b}{P_b}$$
3. Choose a bundle on the budget line 
4. Choose a bundle where the Marginal Rate of Substitution (slope of line) equals slope of Budget Line

### Consumer Equilibrium
If consumers are maximizing utility given the price they face

When not in consumer equilibrium, meaning $\frac{MU_a}{P_a}\neq\frac{MU_b}{P_b}$, then one good is favored than the other until its marginal utility decreases enough to create an equality.

### Elasticity
* **Inelastic**
	* Marginal utility changes very rapidly with change in price
	* Therefore an inequality with an inelastic good will quickly return to equilibrium
		* Since when there is an inequality, more money is placed on other good, and so price changes, which leads to marginal utility to drastically change
		* 
* **Elastic**
	* Marginal utility changes slowly change with price
	* Large amount of money must be moved to other good to restore equality
		* Since marginal utility does not change fast enough to restore equilibrium quickly

## Income ($m$)
>>>>> ![](/consumerEquilibrium.png)

* **Function of Budget Line**
	* Let $x$ be amount of good $x$ and $P_x$ be price of $x$ and $y$ be amount of good $y$ and $P_y$ be price of $y$
	* $$P_xx+P_yy=m$$
	* $$y=-\frac{P_x}{P_y}x+\frac{m}{P_y}$$
		* x-intercept: $\frac{m}{p_x}$



		* y-intercept: $\frac{m}{p_y}$
		* slope: $-\frac{P_x}{P_y}$
			* Opportunity cost/marginal cost

### Indifference Curve
* Consumer equilibrium will never be at the indifference curve's intersection with budget line when there are two intersection
* Consumer Equilibrium is
	* between intersections, 
	* on the budget line,
	* where indifference curve is tangent to budget line
		* Marginal Rate of Substitution is equal to budget line
	* Not necessarily on center of budget line

### Rise in income
* Budget line increases up and to right, same rules follow
* **One Inferior Good**
	* If new consumer equilibrium has less consumption of a good than old consumer equilibrium, then good is inferior
* **Both Normal Goods**
	* If consumer equilibrium is up and to right of old consumer equilibrium, then both goods are normal

### Change in Price (Indifference Curve and Demand)
* Increase in price of good reduces budget line and consumer equilibrium
* >>![](/risePrice.png)
* Demand Curve for an individual is equivalent to change in consumer equilibrium in price
	* price derivative of consumer equilibrium
* Market $Q_d$ is sum of individual $Q_d$

## Solving For Consumer Equilibrium Using Marginal Utility
### Example
* **Movies**
	* $MU = \frac{1}{\text{movies}}$

* **SB Cubs**
	* $MU = \frac{10}{\text{games}}$

|Number|$MU_{movies}$|$MU_{games}$ |
|:------|:------------|:-------------|
|1        |1                |10                |
|2        |$\frac{1}{2}$ |5                 |
|3        |$\frac{1}{3}$ |$\frac{10}{3}$|

#### Step 1
$$\frac{MU_{mov}}{P_{mov}}=\frac{MU_{game}}{P_{game}}$$
is equivalent to
	$$\frac{1}{P_{mov}}\frac{1}{\text{movies}}=\frac{1}{P_{games}}\frac{10}{\text{games}}$$
Assume $P_{mov}=5$ and $P_{games}=50$, 
	$$\frac{1}{5(\text{movies})}=\frac{1}{5(\text{games})}$$
equivalent to
	$$\text{movies}=\text{games}$$
	
#### Step 2
$$P_{mov}(\text{movies})+P_{games}(\text{games})=m, m \text{ is total income}$$

Let $m=550$,
	$$5(\text{movies})+50(\text{games})=550$$

#### Step 3
Plug in equation 1 to equation 2
		$$5(\text{movies})+50(\text{movies})=550$$
	therefore
		$$\text{movies}=10$$
	and also
		$$\text{games}=10$$
		
### Another Example
* **Given**
	* $m = 200$
	* $P_{opera} = 40$
	* $P_{concert} = 20$

|Number|$MU_{opera}$|$MU_{concerts}$ |
|:------|:------------|:-------------|
|1        | 200            |120               |
|2        | 160            |100               |
|3        | 120            |80                |
|4        | 80             |60                |
|5        | 40             |40                |
|6        | 0               |20.              |

#### Steps
Make Table of bundles that exhaust income then find equal marginal utility per price

|N Opera|MU/P Opera|N Concert | MU/P Concert |
|:------|:------------|:-------------|:----|
|0        |             |10               | |
|1        | 5            |8             | | 
|2        | 4            |6                | 1|
|3        | 3             |4                | 3 |
|4        | 2             |2                | 5 |
|5        | 1               |0              |  |

Therefore 3 Operas and 4 Concerts

## Income and Substitution Effects (Normal Goods)
### Observation
* Change in income changes slope of budget line (opportunity cost)
	* As price increases, opportunity cost of consuming good changes
* Change in price changes purchasing power (indifference curve changes)
	* As price increases, wealth goes down

![](/incomeAndSubstitution.jpg)


* $A$ is original consumer equilibrium
* $Z$ is point where new budget line is parallel to indifference curve
* Measure distance along the axis of price change
### Substitution Effect
* Going from bundle A to Z
* Increase in price increase opportunity cost of good, and so it is less desirable even on the same indifference curve
* Tells shape of indifference curves
* ![](substitutionEffect.png)


### Income Effect
* Going from bundle Z to B
* How much more income is needed to have the same maximizing utility (going from indifference curve after increase in price to old indifference curve with slope of new budget line)
* How people respond to change in income
* ![](incomeEffect.png)

### Change in Good 
* A to B
* Equal to Substitution effect plus Income effect 
	* Directly proportional

### Perfect Complements (example Toothbrushes)
* Indifference Curve is right angle
* A = Z, so no substitution effect
* Bundle B would be right below bundle A, low income effect

## Income and Substitution Effects (Inferior Goods)
![](/incomeAndSubstitutionInferior.jpg)

### Income Effect
* Between bundle Z and A 
* ![](incomeEffectInferior.png)

### Change in Good
* Negative
* Therefore Substitution effect is also negative and Income effect is positive
	* Inversely proportional

## Application of Consumer Equilibrium (EITC)
### Areas
* **Phase In Area**
	* Working one more hour leads to increase in amount of money government gives
		* wage at the end of the day larger than just employee salary
* **Phase Out Area**
	* Working one more hour leads to decrease in amount of money government gives
		* Amount government pays is lower than wage employer pays

### Diagrams
* Let $\ell$ be leisure (hours not working) 
* Let $w$ be wage per hour
* let $T$ be tacos, $P_t=1$
* $$T=(24-\ell)w$$
* $$T+w\ell=24w$$
* 
* **Without EITC**
	* >> ![](noEITC.jpeg)
	* slope is $-w$
* 
* **First 3 Hours:** EITC increase by $w$ for each hour worked
* **After:** EITC decreases by $w$ for each hour worked until it is zero

|Hour|EITC |Firm | Total Income | Change in Income |
|:--|:----|:--- |:-----------|:----------------|
|1   |$w$  |$w$  |$2w$         |$2w$                 |
|2   |$2w$ |$2w$ |$4w$         |$2w$                |
|3   |$3w$ |$3w$ |$6w$         |$2w$                |
|4   |$2w$ |$4w$ |$6w$         |$0$                  |
|5   |$w$  |$5w$  |$6w$         |$0$                 |
|6   |$0$  |$6w$  |$6w$         |$0$                 |

* **With EITC**
	* >> ![](EITC.JPG)
	* slope is $-2w$

#### Effects on Incentives to Work
* **Case 1**
	* **A**: Working more hours than EITC
		* **Working Less**
			* >> ![](EITCpossibility1.JPG)
					* Indifference Curve Is in the EITC phase in area
		* **No Change**
			* >> ![](EITCpossibility2.JPG)
* 
* **Case 2**
	* **A**: starting work hour is in phase out zone
		* So incentive to work less
	* >> ![](EITCpossibility3.JPG)


* 
* **Case 3**
	* **A**: starting work hour is in phase in zone
		* Ambiguous effect
			* Equivalent to a decrease in price of Tacos
	* >> ![](EITCpossibility4.JPG)
* 
* **Case 4**
	* **A**: Individual is not working at all
		* Ambiguous Effect (based on indifference curve)
	* **Start Working after EITC**
		* ![](EITCpossibility5.JPG)
	* **Won't Work even with EITC**
		* ![](EITCpossibility6.JPG)
